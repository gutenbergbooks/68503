<h3 class='c013'>§ 1</h3>

<p class='c014'>There are Alards buried in Winchelsea church—they lie
in the south aisle on their altar tombs, with lions at their feet.
At least one of them went to the Crusades and lies there
cross-legged—the first Gervase Alard, Admiral of the Cinque
Ports and Bailiff of Winchelsea, a man of mighty stature.</p>

<p class='c015'>Those were the days just after the Great Storm, when the
sea swallowed up the first parish of St. Thomas à Becket, and
King Edward laid out a new town on the hoke above Bukenie.
The Alards then were powerful on the marsh, rivals of De
Icklesham and fighters of the Abbot of Fécamps. They were
ship-owners, too, and sent out to sea <em>St. Peter</em>, <em>Nostre Dame</em>
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Nave Dieu</span></i>. Stephen Alard held half a knight’s fee
in the manors of Stonelink, Broomhill and Coghurst, while
William Alard lost thirty sailors, thirty sergeants-at-arms,
and anchors and ropes, in Gascony.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the fifteenth century the family had begun to dwindle—its
power was passing into the hands of the Oxenbridges,
who, when the heiress of the main line married an Oxenbridge,
adopted the Alard arms, the lion within a border
charged with scallop shells. Thus the trunk ended, but a
branch of the William Alards had settled early in the sixteenth
century at Conster Manor, near the village of Leasan, about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>eight miles from Winchelsea. Their shield was argent, three
bars gules, on a canton azure a leopard’s head or.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter Alard re-built Conster in Queen Elizabeth’s day,
making it what it is now, a stone house with three hipped
gables and a huge red sprawl of roof. It stands on the hill
between Brede Eye and Horns Cross, looking down into the
valley of the river Tillingham, with Doucegrove Farm, Glasseye
Farm and Starvecrow Farm standing against the woods
beyond.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Alards became baronets under Charles the First, for
the Stephen Alard of that day was a gentleman of the bedchamber,
and melted down the Alard plate in the King’s lost
cause. Cromwell deprived the family of their lands, but they
came back at the Restoration, slightly Frenchified and intermarried
with the Papist. They were nearly in trouble again
when Dutch William was King, for Gervase Alard, a son in
orders, became a non-juror and was expelled from the family
living of Leasan, though a charge of sedition brought against
him collapsed from lack of substance.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hitherto, though ancient and honourable, the Alards had
never been rich, but during the eighteenth century, successful
dealings with the East India Company brought them wealth.
It was then that they began to buy land. They were no longer
content to look across the stream at Doucegrove, Glasseye
and Starvecrow, in the hands of yeomen, but one by one these
farms must needs become part of their estate. They also
bought all the fine woodlands of the Furnace, the farms
of Winterland and Ellenwhorne at the Ewhurst end of the
Tillingham valley, and Barline, Float and Dinglesden on the
marshes towards Rye. They were now big landowners, but
their land-hunger was still unsatisfied—Sir William, the Victorian
baronet, bought grazings as far away as Stonelink, so
that when his son John succeeded him the Alards of Conster
owned most of the land between Rye and Ewhurst, the Kent
Ditch and the Brede river.</p>

<p class='c015'>John Alard was about thirty years old when he began to
reign. He had spent most of his grown-up life in London-the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>London of gas and crinolines, Disraeli and Nellie Farren,
Tattersalls and Caves of Harmony. He had passed for a buck
in Victorian society, with its corruption hidden under outward
decorum, its romance smothered under ugly riches in stuffy
drawing-rooms. But when the call came to him he valiantly
settled down. In Grosvenor Square they spoke of him behind
their fans as a young man who had sown his wild oats and
was now an eligible husband for the innocent Lucy Kenyon
with her sloping shoulders and vacant eyes. He married her
as his duty and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p class='c015'>He also bought more land, and under him the Alard estates
crept over the Brede River and up Snailham hill towards
Guestling Thorn. But that was only at the beginning of his
squireship. One or two investments turned out badly, and
he was forced to a standstill. Then came the bad days of the
landowners. Lower and lower dropped the price of land and
the price of wheat, hop-substitutes became an electioneering
cry in the Rye division of Sussex and the noble gardens by
the river Tillingham went fallow. Then came Lloyd George’s
Land Act—the rush to the market, the impossibility of sale.
Finally the European war of 1914 swept away the little of
the Alard substance that was left. They found themselves in
possession of a huge ramshackle estate, heavily mortgaged,
crushingly taxed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir John had four sons—Hugh, Peter, George and Gervase—and
three daughters, Doris, Mary and Janet. Hugh and
Peter both went out to fight, and Hugh never came back.
George, following a tradition which had ruled in the family
since the days of the non-juring Gervase, held the living of
Leasan. Gervase at the outbreak of hostilities was only in
his second term at Winchester, being nearly eighteen years
younger than his brother George.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of the girls, only Mary was married, though Doris hinted
at a number of suitors rejected because of their unworthiness
to mate with Alard. Jenny was ten years younger than Mary—she
and Gervase came apart from the rest of the family,
children of middle age and the last of love.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ 2</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A few days before Christmas in the year 1918, most of
the Alards were gathered together in the drawing-room at
Conster, to welcome Peter the heir. He had been demobilised
a month after the Armistice and was now expected home, to
take on himself the work of the estate in the place of his
brother Hugh. The Alards employed an agent, and there
were also bailiffs on one or two of the farms, but the heir’s
presence was badly needed in these difficult days. Sir John
held the authority, and the keenness of his interest was in no
wise diminished by his age; but he was an old man, nearly
seventy-five, and honourably afflicted with the gout. He
could only seldom ride on his grey horse from farm to farm,
snarling at the bailiff or the stockman, winking at the chicken
girl—even to drive out in his heavy Wolsey car gave him chills.
So most days he sat at home, and the work was done by
him indeed, but as it were by current conducted through the
wires of obedient sons and servants.</p>

<p class='c015'>This afternoon he sat by the fire in the last patch of sunlight,
which his wife hankered to have shut off from the damasked
armchair.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It really is a shame to run any risks with that beautiful
colour,” she murmured from the sofa. “You know it hasn’t
been back from Hampton’s a week, and it’s such very expensive
stuff.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why did you choose it?” snarled Sir John.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, it was the best—we’ve always had the best.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Next time you can try the second best as a new experience.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your father really is hopeless,” said Lady Alard in a
loud whisper to her daughter Doris.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sh-sh-sh,” said Doris, equally loud.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very poor as an aside, both of you,” said Sir John.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Reverend George Alard coughed as a preliminary to
changing the conversation.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Our Christmas roses are better than ever this year,” he
intoned.</p>

<p class='c015'>His wife alone supported him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’ll come in beautifully for the Christmas decorations—I
hope there’s enough to go round the font.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d thought of them on the screen, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh no! Christmas roses are so appropriate to the font,
and besides”—archly—“Sir John will let us have some flowers
out of the greenhouse for the screen.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m damned if I will.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Rose Alard flushed at the insult to her husband’s cloth
which she held to lie in the oath; none the less she stuck to
her coaxing.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, but you always have, Sir John.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have I?—Well, as I’ve just told my wife, there’s nothing
like a new experience. I don’t keep three gardeners just to
decorate Leasan church, and the flowers happen to be rather
scarce this year. I want them for the house.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Isn’t he terrible?” Lady Alard’s whispered moan to Doris
once more filled the room.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny laughed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What are you laughing at, Jenny?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I dunno.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She was laughing because she wondered if there was anything
she could say which would not lead to a squabble.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perhaps Gervase will come by the same train as Peter,”
she ventured.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase never let us know when to expect him,” said her
mother. “He’s very thoughtless. Now perhaps Appleby will
have to make the journey twice.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It won’t kill Appleby if he does—he hasn’t had the car
out all this week.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But Gervase is very thoughtless,” said Mrs. George Alard.</p>

<p class='c015'>At that moment a slide of wheels was heard in the drive,
and the faint sounds of a car coming to anchor.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter!” cried Lady Alard.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“He’s been quick,” said Doris.</p>

<p class='c015'>George pulled out his watch to be sure about the time,
and Jenny ran to the door.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 3</h3>

<p class='c014'>The drawing-room was just as it had always been....
The same heavy dignity of line in the old walls and oak-ribbed
ceiling spoilt by undue crowding of pictures and furniture.
Hothouse flowers stood about in pots and filled
vases innumerable&#160;... a water-colour portrait of himself as
a child faced him as he came into the room.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter, my darling!”</p>

<p class='c015'>His mother’s arms were stretched out to him from the sofa—she
did not rise, and he knelt down beside her for a moment,
letting her enfold him and furiously creating for
himself the illusion of a mother he had never known. The
illusion seemed to dissipate in a faint scent of lavender
water.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How strange you look out of uniform—I suppose that’s a
new suit.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I could scarcely have got into my pre-war clothes.
I weigh thirteen stone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Quite the heavy Squire,” said Sir John. “Come here and
let’s have a look at you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter went over and stood before his father’s chair—rather
like a little boy. As it happened he was a man of thirty-six,
tallish, well-built, with a dark, florid face, dark hair and a
small dark moustache. In contrast his eyes were of an astounding
blue—Saxon eyes, the eyes of Alards who had gone
to the Crusades, melted down their plate for the White King,
refused to take the oath of allegiance to Dutch William; eyes
which for long generations had looked out on the marshes
of Winchelsea, and had seen the mouth of the Rother swept
in spate from Romney sands to Rye.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Um,” said Sir John.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Having a bad turn again, Sir?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Getting over it—I’ll be about tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s right, and how’s Mother?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m better today, dear. But Dr. Mount said he really was
frightened last week—I’ve never had such an attack.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why didn’t anyone tell me? I could have come down
earlier.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wanted to have you sent for, dear, but the children
wouldn’t let me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The children, as represented by George Alard and his wife,
threw a baffled glance at Peter, seeking to convey that the
“attack” had been the usual kind of indigestion which Lady
Alard liked to enoble by the name of Angina Pectoris.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile, Wills the butler and a young footman were
bringing in the tea. Jenny poured it out, the exertion being
considered too great for her mother. Peter’s eyes rested on
her favourably; she was the one thing in the room, barring
the beautiful, delicate flowers, that gave him any real pleasure
to look at. She was a large, graceful creature, with a creamy
skin, wide, pale mouth, and her mother’s eyes of speckled
brown. Her big, beautifully shaped hands moved with a slow
grace among the teacups. In contrast with her Doris looked
raddled (though she really was moderate and skillful in the
make-up of her face and hair) and Rose looked blowsy. He
felt glad of Jenny’s youth—soft, slow, asleep.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where’s Mary?” he asked suddenly, “I thought she was
coming down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not till New Year’s eve. Julian can’t come with her, and
naturally he didn’t want her to be away for Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And how is the great Julian?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t know—Mary didn’t say. She hardly ever tells us
anything in her letters.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The door opened and the butler announced—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dr. Mount has come to see her ladyship.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Dr. Mount”&#160;... cried Peter, springing up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s waiting in the morning room, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Show him in here—you’d like him to come in, wouldn’t
you, Mother?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, of course, dear, but I expect he’ll have had his tea.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He can have another. Anyhow, I’d like to see him—I
missed him last leave.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He crossed over to the window. Outside in the drive a
small green Singer car stood empty.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Did Stella drive him over?—She would never stay outside.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t see anyone—Hello, doctor—glad you’ve come—have
some tea.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Dr. Mount came into the room. He was a short, healthy
little man, dressed in country tweeds, and with the flat whiskers
of an old-time squire. He seemed genuinely delighted
to see Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Back from the wars? Well, you’ve had some luck. They
say it’ll be more than a year before everyone’s demobbed.
You look splendid, doesn’t he, Lady Alard?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—Peter always was healthy, you know.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I must say he hasn’t given me much trouble. I’d be a
poor man if everyone was like him. How’s the wound, Peter?
I don’t suppose you even think of it now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t say I do—it never was much. Didn’t Stella drive
you over?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—there’s a lot of medicine to make up, so I left her
busy in the dispensary.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What a useful daughter to have,” sighed Lady Alard.
“She can do everything—drive the car, make up medicines——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Work in the garden and cook me a thundering good dinner
besides!” The little doctor beamed. “I expect she’ll be
over here before long, she’ll be wanting to see Peter. She’d
have come today if there han’t been such a lot to do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter put down his teacup and walked over again to the
window. Rose Alard and her husband exchanged another of
those meaning looks which they found a useful conversational
currency.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ 4</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Jenny soon wearied of the drawing-room, even when freshened
by Dr. Mount. She always found a stifling quality in
Conster’s public rooms, with their misleading show of wealth,
and escaped as early as she could to the old schoolroom at the
back of the house, looking steeply up through firs at the
wooded slope of Brede Eye.</p>

<p class='c015'>This evening the room was nearly dark, for the firs shut
out the dregs of twilight and the moon that looked over the
hill. She could just see the outlines of the familiar furniture,
the square table on which she and Gervase had scrawled abusive
remarks in the intervals of their lessons, the rocking chair,
where the ghost of Nurse sometimes still seemed to sit and
sway, the bookcase full of children’s books—“Fifty-two
Stories for Girls” and “Fifty-two Stories for Boys,” the “Girls
of St. Wode’s” and “With Wallace at Bannockburn”—all those
faded gilded rows which she still surreptitiously enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now she had an indefinite feeling that someone was in the
room, but had scarcely realised it when a shape drew itself
up against the window square, making her start and gasp.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s only me,” said an apologetic voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase!”</p>

<p class='c015'>She switched on the light and saw her brother standing by
the table.</p>

<p class='c015'>“When did you come?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, twenty minutes ago. I heard you all gassing away in
the drawing-room, so thought I’d come up here till you’d
finished with Peter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How sociable and brotherly of you! You might have
come in and said how d’you do. You haven’t seen him for
a year.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I thought I’d be an anti-climax—spoil the Warrior’s Return
and all that. I’ll go down in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How was it you and Peter didn’t arrive together? There
hasn’t been another train since.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I expect Peter came by Ashford, didn’t he? I came down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>on the other line and got out at Robertsbridge. I thought I’d
like the walk.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What about your luggage?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I left that at Robertsbridge.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Really, Gervase, you are the most unpractical person I
ever struck. This means we’ll have to send over tomorrow
and fetch it—and Appleby has something better to do than
tear about the country after your traps.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll fetch ’em myself in Henry Ford. Don’t be angry with
me, Jenny. Please remember I’ve come home and expect to
be treated kindly.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He came round the table to her and offered her his cheek.
He was taller than she was, more coltish and less compact, but
they were both alike in being their mother’s children, Kenyons
rather than Alards. Their eyes were soft and golden-brown
instead of clear Saxon-blue, their skins were pale and
their mouths wide.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny hugged him. She was very fond of Gervase, who
seemed specially to belong to her at the end of the long,
straggled family.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m so glad you’ve come,” she murmured—“come for
good. Though I suppose you’ll be off to a crammer’s before
long.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I daresay I shall, but don’t let’s worry about that now.
I’m here till February, anyway. Who’s at home?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Everybody except Mary, and she’s coming after Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wish she’d come before. I like old Mary, and I haven’t
seen her for an age. Is Julian coming too?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t suppose so. He and Father have had a dreadful
row.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What about?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He wouldn’t lend us any of the money he profiteered out
of those collapsible huts.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I call it rather cheek of Father to have asked him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was to be on a mortgage of course; but I quite see it
wouldn’t have been much of an investment for Julian. However,
Father seems to think it was his duty as a son-in-law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>to have let us have it. We’re nearly on the rocks, you know.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So I’ve been told a dozen times, but the place looks much
the same as ever.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s because Father and Mother can’t get out of their
grooves, and there are so few economies which seem worth
while. I believe we need nearly fifty thousand to clear the
estate.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But it’s silly to do nothing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t see what we can do. But I never could understand
about mortgages.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nor could I. The only thing I can make out is that our
grandfather was a pretty awful fool.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He couldn’t read the future. He couldn’t tell the price
of land was going down with a bump, and that there would be
a European war. I believe we’d have been all right if it
hadn’t been for the war.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No we shouldn’t—we were going down hill before that.
The war only hurried things on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well certainly it didn’t do for us what it did for Julian—Seventy
thousand pounds that man’s made out of blood.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then I really do think he might let us have some of it.
What’s Mary’s opinion?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny shrugged.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I dunno. He’s had a row with her too.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What?—about the same thing?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—about a man she’s friends with. It’s ridiculous really,
for he’s years and years older than she is—a retired naval
officer—and awfully nice; I lunched with them both once in
town. But it pleases Julian to be jealous, and I believe poor
Mary’s had a hideous time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Lord! What upheavals since I was home last! Why
doesn’t anyone ever write and tell me about these things?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Because we’re all too worried and too lazy. But you’ve
heard everything now—and you really must come down and
see Peter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m coming in a moment. But tell me first—has he changed
at all? It’s more than a year since I saw him.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“I don’t think he’s changed much, except that he’s got
stouter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wonder what he’ll do with himself now he’s home. Is
there really a rumour, or have I only dreamed, that he’s keen
on Stella Mount?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I believe he’s keen enough. But she hasn’t got a penny.
Father will be sick if he marries her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She switched off the light, and the window changed from a
deep, undetailed blue to a pallid, star-pricked grey, swept
across by the tossing branches of trees.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c014'>At Conster Manor dinner was always eaten in state. Lady
Alard took hers apart in her sitting-room, and sometimes Doris
had it with her. On his “bad days” Sir John was wont to
find Doris a convenient butt, and as she was incapable either
of warding off or receiving gracefully the arrows of his wrathful
wit, she preserved her dignity by a totally unappreciated
devotion to her mother. Tonight, however, she could hardly
be absent, in view of Peter’s return, and could only hope
that the presence of the heir would distract her father from his
obvious facilities.</p>

<p class='c015'>George and Rose had stayed to dinner in honour of the occasion
or rather had come back from a visit to Leasan Vicarage
for the purpose of changing their clothes. Rose always
resented having to wear evening dress when “just dining
with the family.” At the Rectory she wore last year’s summer
gown, and it seemed a wicked waste to have to put on one
of her only two dance frocks when invited to Conster. But
it was a subject on which Sir John had decided views.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Got a cold in your chest, Rose?” he had inquired, when
once she came in her parsonage voile and fichu, and on another
occasion had coarsely remarked: “I like to see a woman’s
shoulders. Why don’t you show your shoulders, Rose? In
my young days every woman showed her shoulders if she’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>got any she wasn’t ashamed of. But nowadays the women
run either to bone or muscle—so perhaps you’re right.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Most of the Alard silver was on the table—ribbed, ponderous
stuff of eighteenth century date, later than the last of
the lost causes in which so much had been melted down. Some
fine Georgian and Queen Anne glass and a Spode dinner-service
completed the magnificence, which did not, however,
extend to the dinner itself. Good cooks were hard to find and
ruinously expensive, requiring also their acolytes; so the soup
in the Spode tureen might have appeared on the dinner-table
of a seaside boarding-house, the fish was represented by
greasily fried plaice, followed by a leg of one of the Conster
lambs, reduced by the black magic of the kitchen to the flavour
and consistency of the worst New Zealand mutton.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter noted that things had “gone down,” and had evidently
been down for a considerable time, judging by the placidity
with which (barring a few grumbles from Sir John) the
dinner was received and eaten. The wine, however, was good—evidently
the pre-war cellar existed. He began to wonder
for the hundredth time what he had better do to tighten
the Alard finances—eating bad dinners off costly plate seemed
a poor economy. Also why were a butler and two footmen
necessary to wait on the family party? The latter were hard-breathing
young men, recently promoted from the plough,
and probably cheap enough, but why should his people keep
up this useless and shoddy state when their dear lands were
in danger? Suppose that in order to keep their footmen and
their silver and their flowers they had to sell Ellenwhorne or
Glasseye—or, perhaps, even Starvecrow....</p>

<p class='c015'>After the dessert of apples from Conster orchard and a
dish of ancient nuts which had remained untasted and unchanged
since the last dinner-party, the women and Gervase
left the table for the drawing-room. Gervase had never sought
to emphasise his man’s estate by sitting over his wine—he always
went out like this with the women, and evidently meant
to go on doing so now he had left school. George on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>other hand remained, though he rather aggressively drank nothing
but water.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s not that I consider there is anything wrong in drinking
wine,” he explained broad-mindedly to Sir John and Peter,
“but I feel I must set an example.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“To whom?” thundered Sir John.</p>

<p class='c015'>“To my parishioners.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, then, since you’re not setting it to us, you can clear
out and join the ladies. I won’t see you sit there despising
my port—which is the only good port there’s been in the Rye
division since ’16—besides I want a private talk with Peter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The big clergyman rose obediently and left the room, his
feelings finding only a moment’s expression at the door, when
he turned round and tried (not very successfully) to tell
Peter by a look that Sir John must not be allowed to drink too
much port in his gouty condition.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s a fool,” said his father just before he had shut the
door. “I don’t know what the church is coming to. In my
young days the Parson drank his bottle with the best of ’em.
He didn’t go about being an example. Bah! who’s going to
follow Georgie’s example?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Who, indeed?” said Peter, who had two separate contempts
for parsons and his brother George, now strengthened by combination.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, pass me the port anyhow. Look here, I want to
talk to you—first time I’ve got you alone. What are you going
to do now you’re back?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t know, Sir. I’ve scarcely had time to think.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re the heir now, remember. I’d rather you stayed
here. You weren’t thinking of going back into Lightfoot’s,
were you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t see myself in the city again. Anyhow I’d sooner
be at Conster.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s right. That’s your place now. How would you
like to be Agent?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d like it very much, Sir. But can it be done? What
about Greening?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“He’s an old fool, and has been muddling things badly the
last year or two. He doesn’t want to stay. I’ve been talking
to him about putting you in, and he seemed glad.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d be glad too, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You ought to know more about the estate than you do.
It’ll be yours before long—I’m seventy-five, you know. When
Hugh was alive I thought perhaps a business career was best
for you, so kept you out of things. You’ll have to learn a
lot.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I love the place, Sir—I’m dead keen.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I remember you always wanted.... Of course I’ll
put you into Starvecrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Starvecrow!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t repeat my words. The Agent has always lived at
Starvecrow, and there are quite enough of us here in the
house. Besides there’s another thing. How old are you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thirty-six.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Time you married, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I suppose it is.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I was thirty, myself, when I married, but thirty-six is rather
late. How is it you haven’t married earlier?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I dunno—the war I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The war seems to have had the opposite effect on most
people. But my children don’t seem a marrying lot. Doris&#160;... Hugh&#160;... there’s Mary, of course, and George, but I
don’t congratulate either of ’em. Julian’s a mean blackguard,
and Rose——” Sir John defined Rose in terms most unsuitable
to a clergyman’s wife.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You really must think about it now,” he continued—“you’re
the heir; and of course you know—we want money.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter did not speak.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We want money abominably,” said Sir John, “in fact I
don’t know how we’re to carry on much longer without it. I
don’t want to have to sell land—indeed, it’s practically impossible,
all trussed up as we are. Starvecrow could go, of
course, but it’s useful for grazing and timber.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re not thinking of selling Starvecrow?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“I don’t want to—we’ve had it nearly two hundred years;
it was the first farm that Giles Alard bought. But it’s also
the only farm we’ve got in this district that isn’t tied—there’s
a mortgage on the grazings down by the stream, but the house
is free, with seventy acres.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It would be a shame to let it go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter was digging into the salt-cellar with his dessert knife.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I rely on you to help me keep it. Manage the estate
well and marry money.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re damn cynical, Sir. Got any especial—er—money
in your mind?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, no—of course not. But you ought to get married at
your age, and you might as well marry for the family’s advantage
as well as your own.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter was silent.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I know there’s a lot to be said against getting married,
but in your position—heir to a title and a big estate—it’s
really a duty. I married directly my father died. But don’t
you wait for that—you’re getting on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But who am I to marry? There’s not such a lot of rich
girls round here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll soon find one if you make up your mind to it.
My plan is first make up your mind to get married and then
look for the girl—not the other way round, which is what most
men do, and leads to all kinds of trouble. Of course I know
it isn’t always convenient. But what’s your special objection?
Any entanglement? Don’t be afraid to tell me. I know there’s
often a little woman in the way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter squirmed at his father’s Victorian ideas of dissipation
with their “little women.” He’d be talking of “French
dancers” next....</p>

<p class='c015'>“I haven’t any entanglement, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then you take my words to heart. I don’t ask you to
marry for money, but marry where money is, as Shakespeare
or somebody said.”</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>§ 6</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Peter found a refreshing solitude in the early hours of
the next day. His mother and Doris breakfasted upstairs, his
father had characteristically kept his promise to “be about
tomorrow,” and had actually ridden out before Peter appeared
in the morning room at nine. Jenny, who was a lazy young
woman, did not come down till he had finished, and Gervase,
in one of those spasms of eccentricity which made Peter sometimes
a little ashamed of him, had gone without breakfast altogether,
and driven off in the Ford lorry to fetch his luggage,
sustained by an apple.</p>

<p class='c015'>The morning room was full of early sunlight—dim as yet,
for the mists were still rising from the Tillingham valley and
shredding slowly into the sky. The woods and farms beyond
the river were hidden in the same soft cloud. Peter opened
the window, and felt the December rasp in the air. Oh, it was
good to be back in this place, and one with it now, the heir....
No longer the second son who must live away from home
and make his money in business.... He stifled the disloyalty
to his dead brother. Poor old Hugh, who was so solemn and
so solid and so upright.... But Hugh had never loved the
place as he did—he had never been both transported and abased
by his honour of inheritance.</p>

<p class='c015'>As soon as he had eaten his breakfast Peter went out, at
his heels a small brown spaniel, who for some reason had not
gone with the other dogs after Sir John. They went down
the garden, over the half melted frost of the sloping lawns,
through the untidy shrubbery of fir, larch and laurel, to the
wooden fence that shut off Conster from the marshes of the
Tillingham. The river here had none of the pretensions with
which it circled Rye, but was little more than a meadow-stream,
rather full and angry with winter. Beyond it, just
before the woods began, lay Beckley Furnace with its idle
mill.</p>

<p class='c015'>And away against the woods lay Starvecrow&#160;... just as
he had dreamed of it so many times in France, among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>blasted fields. “Starvecrow”—he found himself repeating the
name aloud, but not as it was written on the map, rather as
it was written on the lips of the people to whom its spirit belong—“Starvycrow&#160;... Starvycrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It was a stone house built about the same time as Conster,
but without the compliment to Gloriana implied in three gables.
It lacked the grace of Conster—the grace both of its building
and of its planting. It stood foursquare and forthright
upon the slope, with a great descent of wavy, red-brown roof
towards the mouth of the valley, a shelter from the winds
that came up the Tillingham from the sea. It seemed preeminently
a home, sheltered, secure, with a multitude of chimneys
standing out against the background of the woods. From
one of them rose a straight column of blue smoke, unwavering
in the still, frost-thickened air.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter crossed the stream by the bridge, then turned up
Starvecrow’s ancient drive. There was no garden, merely an
orchard with a planting of flowers under the windows. Peter
did not ring, but walked straight in at the side door. The
estate office had for long years been at Starvecrow, a low
farmhouse room in which the office furniture looked incongruous
and upstart.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll change all this,” thought Peter to himself—I’ll have
a gate-legged table and Jacobean chairs.</p>

<p class='c015'>The room was empty, but the agents wife had heard him
come in.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That you, Mr. Alard? I thought you’d be over. Mr.
Greening’s gone to Winterland this morning. They were complaining
about their roof. He said he’d be back before lunch.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter shook hands with Mrs. Greening and received rather
abstractedly her congratulations on his return. He was wondering
if she knew he was to supplant them at Starvecrow.</p>

<p class='c015'>She did, for she referred to it the next minute, and to his
relief did not seem to resent the change.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’re getting old people, and for some time I’ve been
wanting to move into the town. It’ll be a good thing to have
you here, Mr. Alard—bring all the tenants more in touch with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the family. Not that Sir John doesn’t do a really amazing
amount of work....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She rambled on, then suddenly apologised for having to
leave him—a grandchild staying in the house was ill.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Shall you wait for Mr. Greening? I’m afraid he won’t
be in for an hour at least.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll wait for a bit anyway. I’ve some letters to write.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He went into the office and sat down. The big ugly rolltop
desk was littered with papers—memoranda, bills, estimates,
plans of farms, lists of stock-prices. He cleared a space,
seized a couple of sheets of the estate note-paper, and began
to write.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My loveliest Stella,” he wrote.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 7</h3>

<p class='c014'>He had nearly covered the two sheets when the rattle of a
car sounded in the drive below. He looked up eagerly and
went to the window, but it was only Gervase lurching over
the ruts in the Ford, just scraping past the wall as he swung
round outside the house, just avoiding a collision with an
outstanding poplar, after the usual manner of his driving.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next minute he was in the office.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hullo! They told me you were over here. I’ve just
fetched my luggage from Robertsbridge.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He sat down on the writing-table and lit a cigarette. Peter
hastily covered up his letter. Why did Gervase come bothering
him now?</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wanted to speak to you,” continued his brother. “You’ll
be the best one to back me up against Father.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What is it now?” asked Peter discouragingly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“An idea came to me while I was driving over. I often
get ideas when I drive, and this struck me as rather a good
one. I think it would be just waste for me to go to a crammer’s
and then to Oxford. I don’t want to go in for the church
or the bar or schoolmastering or anything like that, and I don’t
see why the family should drop thousands on my education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>just because I happen to be an Alard. I want to go in for
engineering in some way and you don’t need any ’Varsity for
that. I could go into some sort of a shop....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, if the way you drive a car is any indication——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can drive perfectly well when I think about it. Besides,
that won’t be my job. I want to learn something in the way
of construction and all that. I always was keen, and it strikes
me now that I’d much better go in for that sort of thing than
something which won’t pay for years. There may be some
sort of a premium to fork out, but it’ll be nothing compared
to what it would cost to send me to Oxford.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You talk as if we were paupers,” growled Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, so we are, aren’t we?” said Gervase brightly. “Jenny
was talking to me about it last night. She says we pay thousands
a year in interest on mortgages, and as for paying them
off and selling the land, which is the only thing that can help
us....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t see that it’s your job, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I could help. Really it seems a silly waste to send me
to Oxford when I don’t want to go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You need Oxford more than any man I know. If you
went there you might pick up some notions of what’s done,
and get more like other people.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I shouldn’t get more like other people, only more like
other Oxford men.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter scowled. He intensely disapproved of the kid’s verbal
nimbleness, which his more weighty, more reputable argument
could only lumber after.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ve got to remember you’re a gentleman’s son,” he remarked
in a voice which suggested sitting down just as Gervase’s
had suggested a skip and a jump.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, lots of them go in for engineering. We’re in such
a groove. I daresay you think this is just a sudden idea of
mine——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ve just told me it is.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know, but I’ve been thinking for ages that I didn’t want
to go to Oxford. If I took up engineering I could go into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>shop at Ashford.... But I’ll have to talk to Father about
it. I expect he’ll be frightfully upset—the only Alard who
hasn’t been to the Varsity and all that&#160;... but, on the other
hand, he’s never bothered about me so much as about you and
George, because there’s no chance of my coming into the
estate.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wouldn’t be too sure,” gibed Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, of course, you might both die just to spite me—but
it wouldn’t be sporting of you. I don’t want to be Sir Gervase
Alard, Bart.—I’d much rather be Alard and Co., Motor-engineers.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You damn well shan’t be that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, it’s a long time ahead, anyway. But do back me up
against Father about not going to Oxford. It really ought to
help us a lot if I don’t go—a son at the ’Varsity’s a dreadful
expense, and when that son’s me, it’s a waste into the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’ll see about it. My idea is that you need Oxford
more than—hullo, who’s that?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dr. Mount,” said Gervase looking out of the window.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter rose and looked out too, in time to see the doctor’s
car turning in the sweep. This morning he himself was not
at the wheel, but was driven by what looked like a warm bundle
of furs with a pair of bright eyes looking out between collar
and cap.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter opened the window.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella!” he cried.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 8</h3>

<p class='c014'>A minute later Stella Mount was in the room. Gervase had
not seen her for several years; during the greater part of the
war she had been away from home, first at a munition factory,
then as an auxiliary driver to the Army Service Corps. When
last they had met the gulf between the schoolboy of fourteen
and the girl of twenty had yawned much wider than between
the youth of eighteen and the young woman of twenty-four.
Stella looked, if anything, younger than she had looked four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>years ago, and he was also of an age to appreciate her beauty
which he had scarcely noticed on the earlier occasions.</p>

<p class='c015'>In strict point of fact Stella was not so much beautiful
as pretty, for there was nothing classic in her little heart-shaped
face, with its wide cheek-bones, pointed chin and puckish
nose. On the other hand there was nothing of that fragile,
conventional quality which prettiness is understood to mean.
Everything about Stella was healthy, warm and living—her
plump little figure, the glow on her cheeks, the shine of her
grey eyes between their lashes, like pools among reeds, the decision
of her chin and brows, the glossy, tumbling masses of
her hair, all spoke of strength and vigour, a health that was
almost hardy.</p>

<p class='c015'>She came into the room like a flame, and Gervase felt his
heart warming. Then he remembered that she was Peter’s—Jenny
had said so, though she had not blessed Peter’s possession.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How d’you do, Stella?” he said, “it’s ages since we met.
Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course I do. You haven’t altered much, except in height.
You’ve left Winchester for good now, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—and I’ve just been arguing with Peter about what I’m
to do with myself now I’m home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How very practical of you! I hope Peter was helpful.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not in the least.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He could feel Peter’s eyes upon him, telling him to get out
of the way and leave him alone with his bright flame....</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I must push off—they may be wanting the Ford at
home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He shook hands with Stella, nodded to Peter, and went out.</p>

<p class='c015'>For a moment Peter and Stella faced each other in silence.
Then Peter came slowly up to her and took her in his arms,
hiding his face in her neck.</p>

<p class='c015'>“O Stella—O my beauty!...”</p>

<p class='c015'>She did not speak, but her arms crept round him. They
could scarcely meet behind his broad back—she loved this
feeling of girth which she could not compass, combined as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>was with a queer tender sense of his helplessness, of his dependence
on her——</p>

<p class='c015'>“O Peter,” she whispered—“my little Peter....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I was writing to you, darling, when you came.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And I was on my way to see you at Conster. Father was
going there after he’d called on little Joey Greening. I
wouldn’t come yesterday—I thought your family would be
all over you, and I didn’t like....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She broke off the sentence and he made no effort to trim
the ragged end. Her reference to his family brought back
into his thoughts the conversation he had had with his father
over the wine. She had always felt his family as a cloud, as
a barrier between them, and it would be difficult to tell her
that now he was the heir, now he was home from the war,
instead of being removed the cloud would be heavier and the
barrier stronger.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m so glad you came here”—he breathed into her hair—“that
our first meeting’s at Starvecrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—I’m glad, too.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter sat down in the leather-covered office chair, holding
Stella on his knee.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Child—they’re going to give me Starvecrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“O Peter!”...</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—Greening wants to leave, and my father’s making me
agent in his place.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How lovely! Shall you come and live here?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The monosyllable came gruffly because of the much more
that he wanted to say. It was a shame to have such reserves
spoil their first meeting.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m so awfully, wonderfully glad, Peter darling.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She hid her soft, glowing face in his neck—she was lying
on his breast like a child, but deliciously heavy, her feet swung
off the floor.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella—my sweetheart—beautiful....”</p>

<p class='c015'>His love for her gave him a sweet wildness of heart, and
he who was usually slow of tongue, became almost voluble——</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“Oh, I’ve longed for this—I’ve thought of this, dreamed of
this.... And you’re lovelier than ever, you dear.... Stella,
sweetheart, let me look into your eyes—close to—like that&#160;... your eyelashes turn back like the petals of a flower....
O you wonderful, beautiful thing&#160;... And it’s so lovely
we should have met here instead of at home—the dearest
person in the dearest place&#160;... Stella at Starvecrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Starvycrow,” she repeated gently.</p>

<p class='c015'>For a moment he felt almost angry that she should have used
his name—his private music. But his anger melted into his
love. She used his name because she, alone in all the world,
felt his feelings and thought his thoughts. Perhaps she did
not love Starvecrow quite as he did, but she must love it very
nearly as much or she would not call it by its secret name.
They sat in silence, her head upon his shoulder, his arms about
her, gathering her up on his knees. On the hearth a log fire
softly hummed and sighed. Ages seemed to flow over them,
the swift eternities of love.... Then suddenly a voice called
“Stella!” from the drive.</p>

<p class='c015'>She started up, and the next moment was on her feet, pushing
away her hair under her cap, buttoning her high collar
over her chin.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How quick Father’s been! I feel as if I’d only just come.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You must come again.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m coming to dinner on Christmas day, you know.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That doesn’t count. I want you here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And I want to be here with you—always.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The last word was murmured against his lips as he kissed
her at the door. He was not quite sure if he had heard it.
During the rest of the morning he sometimes feared not—sometimes
hoped not.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 9</h3>

<p class='c014'>“It will be a green Christmas,” said Dr. Mount.</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella made no answer. The little car sped through the lanes
at the back of Benenden. They had driven far—to the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>edge of the doctor’s wide-flung practice, by Hawkhurst and
Skullsgate, beyond the Kent Ditch. They had called at both
the Nineveh farms—Great Nineveh and Little Nineveh—and
had now turned south again. The delicate blue sky was drifted
over with low pinkish clouds, which seemed to sail very close
to the field where their shadows moved; the shadows swooped
down the lane with the little car, rushing before it into Sussex.
Stella loved racing the sky.</p>

<p class='c015'>On her face, on her neck, she could still feel cold places
where Peter had kissed her. It was wonderful and beautiful,
she thought, that she should carry the ghosts of his kisses
through Sussex and Kent. And now she would not have so
long to be content with ghosts—there would not be those terrible
intervals of separation. She would see Peter again soon,
and the time would come—must come—when they would be
together always. “Together always” was the fulfilment of
Stella’s dream. “They married and were together always”
sounded better in her ears than “they married and lived happy
ever after.” No more partings, no more ghosts of kisses,
much as she loved those ghosts, but always the dear, warm
bodily presence—Peter working, Peter resting, Peter sleepy,
Peter hungry, Peter talking, Peter silent—Peter always.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It will be a green Christmas,” repeated Dr. Mount.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Er—did you speak, Father dear?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I said it would be a gr——but never mind, I’m sure
your thoughts are more interesting than anything I could say.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella blushed. She and her father had a convention of
silence between them in regard to Peter. He knew all about
him, of course, but they both pretended that he didn’t; because
Stella felt she had no right to tell him until Peter had definitely
asked her to be his wife. And he had not asked her yet. When
they had first fallen in love, Hugh Alard was still alive and the
second son’s prospects were uncertain; then when Hugh was
killed and Peter became the heir, there was still the war, and
she knew that her stolid, Saxon Peter disapproved of war-weddings
and grass widows who so often became widows indeed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>He had told her then he could not marry her till after
the war, and she had treated that negative statement as the beginning
of troth between them. She had never questioned
or pressed him—it was not her way—she had simply taken
him for granted. She had felt that he could not, any more
than she, be satisfied with less than “together always.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But now she felt that something definite must happen soon,
and their tacit understanding become open and glorious. His
family would disapprove, she knew, though they liked her personally
and owed a great deal to her father. But Stella, outside
and unaware, made light of Conster’s opposition. Peter
was thirty-six and had five hundred a year of his own, so in
her opinion could afford to snap his fingers at Alard tyranny.
Besides, she felt sure the family would “come round”—they
would be disappointed at first, but naturally they wouldn’t
expect Peter to give up his love-choice simply because she had
no money. She would be glad when things were open and acknowledged,
for though her secret was a very dear one, she
was sometimes worried by her own shifts to keep it, and hurt
by Peter’s. It hurt her that he should have to pretend not to
care about her when they met in public—but not so much as
it would have hurt her if he hadn’t done it so badly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, now he’s back, I suppose Peter will take the eldest
son’s place,” said Dr. Mount, “and help his father manage the
property.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—he told me this morning that Sir John wants him to
be agent instead of Mr. Greening, and he’s to live at Starvecrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“At Starvecrow! You’ll like that—I mean, it’s nice to
think Peter won’t have to go back and work in London. I
always felt he belonged here more than Hugh.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I don’t think Hugh cared for the place very much,
but Peter always did. It always seemed hard lines that he
should be the second son.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Poor Hugh,” said Dr. Mount—“he was very like Peter in
many ways—Sober and solid and kind-hearted; but he hadn’t
Peter’s imagination.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Peter’s very sensitive,” said Stella—“in spite of his being
such a big, heavy thing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then she smiled, and said in her heart—“Peter’s mine.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 10</h3>

<p class='c014'>Christmas was celebrated at Conster in the manner peculiar
to houses where there is no religion and no child. Tradition
compelled the various members of the family to give each
other presents which they did not want and to eat more food
than was good for them; it also compelled them to pack unwillingly
into the Wolsey car and drive to Leasan church,
where they listened in quite comprehensible boredom to a
sermon by brother George. Peter was able to break free from
this last superstition, and took himself off to the office at
Starvecrow—his family’s vague feeling of unrest at his defection
being compensated by the thought that there really
wouldn’t have been room for him in the car.</p>

<p class='c015'>But Starvecrow was dim and sodden on this green Christmas
day, full of a muggy cloud drifting up from the Tillingham,
and Peter was still sore from the amenities of the
Christmas breakfast table—that ghastly effort to be festive
because it was Christmas morning, that farce of exchanging
presents—all those empty rites of a lost childhood and a lost
faith. He hated Christmas.</p>

<p class='c015'>Also he wanted Stella, and she was not to be had. She
too had gone to church—which he would not have minded, if
she had not had the alternative of being with him here at
Starvecrow. He did not at all object to religion in women
as long as they kept it in its proper place. But Stella did not
keep hers in its proper place—she let it interfere with her daily
life—with his&#160;... and she had not gone to church at Leasan,
which was sanctified to Peter by the family patronage and the
family vault, but to Vinehall, where they did not even have
the decencies of Dearly Beloved Brethren, but embarrassing
mysteries which he felt instinctively to be childish and in bad
taste.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>In Stella’s home this Christmas there would be both religion
and children, the latter being represented by her father and
herself. Last night when he called at Hollingrove—Dr.
Mount’s cottage on the road between Leasan and Vinehall—to
ask her to meet him here today at Starvecrow, he had found
her decorating a Christmas tree, to be put in the church, of
all places. She had asked him to stop and go with her and
her father to the Midnight Mass—“Do come, Peter—we’re
going to make such a lovely noise at the Gloria in Excelsis.
Father Luce has given the boys trays to bang this year.”
But Peter had declined, partly because he disapproved of tray-banging
as a means of giving glory to God, but mostly because
he was hurt that Stella should prefer going to church to being
with him at Starvecrow.</p>

<p class='c015'>She had made a grave mistake, if only she’d known it—leaving
him here by himself today, with his time free to think
about her, and memories of her dark side still fresh in his
mind. For Stella had her dark side, like the moon, though
generally you saw as little of it as the moon’s. In nearly all
ways she was Peter’s satisfaction. He loved her with body
and mind, indeed with a sort of spiritual yearning. He loved
her for her beauty, her sense, her warmth, her affectionate
disposition which expressed itself naturally in love, her freedom
from affectation, and also from any pretensions to wit
or cleverness, and other things which he distrusted. But for
two things he loved her not—her religion and her attitude
towards his family.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hitherto neither had troubled him much. Their meetings
had been so few that they had had but little talk of anything
save love. He had merely realised that though she held the
country round Vinehall and Leasan as dear as even his idolatry
demanded she was very little impressed with the importance
of the family to whom that country belonged. But up in
London that had scarcely mattered. He had also realised that
Stella, as she put it, “tried to be good.” At first he had
thought her wanton—her ready reception of his advances, her
ardent affection, her unguarded manner, had made him think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>she was like the many young women filling London in those
years, escaped from quiet homes into a new atmosphere of
freedom and amorousness, making the most of what might
be short-lived opportunities. But he was glad when he discovered
his mistake. Peter approved of virtue in women,
though he had occasionally taken advantage of its absence.
He certainly would never have married a woman who was not
virtuous, and he soon discovered that he wanted to marry
Stella.</p>

<p class='c015'>But in those days everything flowed like a stream—nothing
was firm, nothing stood still. Things were different now—they
could flow no longer, they must be established; it was now
that Peter realised how much greater these two drawbacks were
than they had seemed at first. Stella’s religion did not consist
merely in preserving his treasure whole till he was ready to
claim it, but in queer ways of denial and squander, exacting
laws, embarrassing consecrations. And her attitude towards
the family gave him almost a feeling of insult—she was so
casual, so unaware&#160;... she did not seem to trouble herself
with its requirements and prohibitions. She did not seem to
realise that the House of Alard was the biggest thing on earth—so
big that it could crush her and Peter, their hope and
romance, into dust. But she would soon find out what it was—whether
they married or not, she would find out.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sometimes—for instance, today—he was almost savagely
glad when he thought how sure she was to find out. Sometimes
he was angry with her for her attitude towards the
family, and for all that she took for granted in his. He knew
that she expected him to marry her whatever happened—with
a naïvety which occasionally charmed but more often irritated
him. She imagined that if his father refused to let them live
at Starvecrow, he would take her and live with her in some
cottage on five hundred a year&#160;... and watch the place go to
ruin without him. She would be sorry not to have Starvecrow,
but she would not care about anything else—she would not
fret in the least about the estate or the outraged feelings of
those who looked to him to help them. She would not even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>have cared if his father had had it in his power—which he
had not—to prevent her ever becoming Lady Alard. Stella
did not care two pins about being Lady Alard—all she wanted
was to be Mrs. Peter. He had loved her for her disinterestedness,
but now he realised that it had its drawbacks. He saw
that his choice had fallen on a woman who was not a good
choice for Alard—not merely because she had no money, but
because she had no pride. He could not picture her at Conster—lady
of the Manor. He could picture her at Starvecrow, but
not at Conster.</p>

<p class='c015'>...&#160;He bowed his head upon the table—it felt heavy with
his thought. Stella was the sweetest, loveliest thing in life,
and sometimes he felt that her winning was worth any sacrifice,
and that he would pay her price not only with his own
renunciation but with all the hopes of his house. But some
unmovable, fundamental part of him showed her to him as
an infatuation, a witch-light, leading him away from the just
claims of his people and his land, urging him to a cruel
betrayal of those who trusted to him for rescue.</p>

<p class='c015'>After all, he had known her only a year. In a sense, of
course, he had known her from her childhood, when she had
first come with her father to Vinehall, but he had not loved
her till he had met her in London a year ago. Only a year....
To Peter’s conservative soul a year was nothing. For
nearly two hundred years the Alards had owned Starvecrow—and
they had been at Conster for three hundred more. Was
he going to sacrifice those century-old associations for the
passion of a short year? He had loved her only a year, and
these places he had loved all his life—and not his life only,
but the lives of those who had come before him, forefathers
whose spirit lived in him, with love for the land which was
his and theirs.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 11</h3>

<p class='c014'>The Christmas tension at the Manor was relieved at dinnertime
by the arrival of George Alard and his wife, Dr. Mount
and Stella, and a young man supposed to be in love with Jenny.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>A family newly settled at the Furnace had also been invited
and though it had always been the custom at Conster to invite
one or two outside people to the Christmas dinner, Rose Alard
considered that this year’s hospitality had gone too far.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s all very well to have Dr. Mount and Stella,” she said
to Doris, “but who are these Hursts? They haven’t been at
the Furnace six months.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’re very rich, I believe,” said Doris.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They may be—but no one knows how they made their
money. I expect it was in trade,” and Rose sniffed, as if she
smelt it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s a young man, I think; perhaps he’ll marry Jenny—he’s
too young for me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But Jenny’s engaged to Jim Parish, isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not that it counts—he hasn’t got a bean, or any prospects
either. We don’t talk of them as engaged.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is she in love with him?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How can I possibly tell?” snapped Doris, who had had a
trying afternoon with her mother, and had also been given
“The Christian Year” for the second time as a present from
Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, don’t bite my head off. I’m sure I hope she isn’t,
and that she’ll captivate this young Hurst, whoever he is.
Then it won’t be so bad having them here, though otherwise
I should feel inclined to protest; for poor George is worn out
after four services and two sermons, and it’s rather hard to
expect him to talk to strangers—especially on Christmas day.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Doris swallowed her resentment audibly—she would not
condescend to quarrel with Rose, whom she looked upon much
as Rose herself looked upon the Hursts, George having married
rather meanly in the suburb of his first curacy.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the Hursts arrived, they consisted of agreeable, vulgar
parents, a smart, modern-looking daughter and a good-looking
son. Unfortunately, the son was soon deprived of his excuse
as a possible husband for Jenny by his mother’s ready reference
to “Billy’s feeonsay”—but it struck both Rose and Doris
separately and simultaneously that it would do just as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>if the daughter Dolly married Peter. She really was an
extraordinarily attractive girl, with her thick golden hair cut
square upon her ears like a mediæval page’s. She was clever,
too—had read all the new books and even met some of the new
authors. Never, thought Rose and Doris, had wealth been so
attractively baited or “trade” been so effectively disguised.
It was a pity Peter was in such bad form tonight, sitting there
beside her, half-silent, almost sullen.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter knew that Dolly Hurst was attractive, he knew that
she was clever, he knew that she was rich, he knew that she
had come out of the gutter—and he guessed that his people
had asked her to Conster tonight in hopes that through him
her riches might save the house of Alard. All this knowledge
crowned by such a guess had the effect of striking him dumb,
and by the time Wills and the footmen had ushered in with
much ceremony a huge, burnt turkey, his neighbour had almost
entirely given up her efforts to “draw him out,” and had turned
in despair to George Alard on her right.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter sat gazing unhappily at Stella. She was next to Gervase,
and was evidently amusing him, to judge by the laughter
which came across the table. That was so like Stella&#160;... she
could always make you laugh. She wasn’t a bit clever, but
she saw and said things in a funny way. She was looking
devilish pretty tonight, too—her hair was done in such a pretty
way, low over her forehead and ears, and her little head was
round and shining like a bun&#160;... the little darling&#160;... and
how well that blue frock became her—showing her dear, lovely
neck&#160;... yes, he thought he’d seen it before, but it looked as
good as new. Stella was never tumbled—except just after he
had kissed her&#160;... the little sweet.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was reacting from his thoughts of her that morning—he
felt a little ashamed of them. After all, why shouldn’t she
have gone to church if she wanted to? Wasn’t it better than
having no religion at all, like many of the hard young women
of his class who shocked his war-born agnosticism with theirs?—or
than having a religion which involved the whole solar
system and a diet of nuts? And as for her treatment of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>family—surely her indifference was better than the eager subservience
more usually found—reverence for a title, an estate,
and a place in the charmed exclusiveness of the “County.”
No, he would be a fool if he sacrificed Stella for any person
or thing whatsoever. He had her to consider, too. She
loved him, and he knew that, though no troth had yet passed
between them, she considered herself bound to the future.
What would she say if she knew he did not consider himself
so bound?... Well, he must bind himself—or let her go free.</p>

<p class='c015'>He longed to talk to her, but his opportunity dragged. To
his restlessness it seemed as if the others were trying to keep
them apart. There was Gervase, silly fool, going out with the
women as usual and sitting beside her in the drawing-room—there
was George, sillier fool, keeping the men back in the
dining-room while he told Mr. Hurst exactly why he had not
gone for an army chaplain. Then directly they had joined the
ladies, both Doris and Rose shot up simultaneously from
beside Dolly Hurst and disposed of themselves one beside Lady
Alard, the other beside Stella. He had to sit down and try
again to be intelligent. It was worse than ever, for he was
watching all the time for Miss Hurst to empty her coffee-cup—then
he would go and put it down on the Sheraton table,
which was not so far from Stella, and after that he would sit
down beside Stella no matter how aggressively Rose was sitting
on her other side.</p>

<p class='c015'>The coffee-cup was emptied in the middle of a discussion
on the relative reputations of Wells and Galsworthy. Peter
immediately forgot what he was saying....</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let me put your cup down for you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He did not wait for a reply, but the next minute he was
on the other side of the room. He realised that he had been
incredibly silly and rude, but it was too late to atone, for Jim
Parish, Jenny’s ineligible young man, had sat down in the chair
he had left.</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella was talking to Rose, but she turned round when Peter
came up and made room beside her on the sofa. Rose felt
annoyed—she thought Stella’s manner was “encouraging,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>began to say something about the sofa being too cramped for
three. However, at that moment Lady Alard called her to
come and hear about Mrs. Hurst’s experiences in London on
Armistice Day, and she had regretfully to leave the two
ineligibles together, with the further complication that the third
ineligible was sitting beside Dolly Hurst—and though Jim
Parish was supposed to be in love with Jenny, everyone knew
he was just as much in need of a rich wife as Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella,” said Peter in a low voice—“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sorry! What for, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c015'>He realised that of course she did not know what he had
been thinking of her that morning.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Everything,” he mumbled, apologizing vaguely for the
future as well as the past.</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella had thought that perhaps this evening “something
would happen.” At Conster—on Christmas night&#160;... the
combination seemed imperative. But Peter did not, as she had
hoped, draw her out of that crowded, overheated room into
some quiet corner of the house or under the cold, dark curtains
of the night. Peter could not quite decide against the family—he
must give it time to plead. He leaned back on the sofa, his
eyes half-closed, tired and silent, yet with a curious peace at
his heart.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re tired, boy,” said Stella—“what have you been doing
today?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve had a hateful day—and I <em>was</em> tired—dog tired; but I’m
not tired any longer now—now I’m with you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Peter, am I restful?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella was satisfied. She felt that was enough—she did not
ask anything more of the night.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 12</h3>

<p class='c014'>It was Gervase, not Peter, who lay awake that night, thinking
of Stella Mount. He had been glad when he was told to take
her in to dinner, and the meal which had been so unspeakably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>trying to his brother had passed delightfully for him. On his
other side sat Doris, deep in conversation with Charles Hurst,
so he did not have to bother about her—he could talk to Stella,
who was so easy to talk to....</p>

<p class='c015'>Afterwards in the drawing-room he had not felt so easy.
He knew that he must not monopolise Stella, for she was
Peter’s. So when he heard the men crossing the hall, he made
some excuse and left her, to see Rose sit down by her side
directly Peter came in. He was glad when poor old Peter had
managed to get near her at last&#160;... though he hadn’t seemed
to make much of his opportunities. He had sat beside her,
stupid and silent, scarcely speaking a word all the evening
through.</p>

<p class='c015'>Upstairs in bed, in his little misshapen room under the north
gable, where he had slept ever since the night-nursery was
given up, Gervase shut his eyes and thought of Stella. She
came before the darkness of his closed eyes in her shining blue
dress—a dress like midnight.... She was the first woman
he had really noticed since in far-back childish days he had had
an infatuation for his rather dull daily governess—his “beautiful
Miss Turner” as he had called her and thought of her
still.... But Stella was different—she was less of a cloud
and a goddess, more of a breathing person. He wondered—was
he falling in love? It was silly to fall in love with
Stella, who was six years older than he&#160;... though people
said that when boys fell in love it was generally with women
older than themselves. But he mustn’t do it. Stella was
Peter’s.... Was she?... Or was it merely true that he
wanted to take her and she wanted to be taken?</p>

<p class='c015'>He did not think there was any engagement, any promise.
Circumstances might finally keep them apart. Rose, Doris,
Jenny, his father and mother—the whole family—did not want
Peter to marry Stella Mount whose face was her fortune.
It was the same everlasting need of money that was making
the same people, except Jenny of course, shrug at poor Jim
Parish, whose people in their turn shrugged at portionless
Jenny. Money—money&#160;... that was what the Squires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>wanted—what they must have if their names were to remain
in the old places.</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase felt rather angry with Peter. He was angry to
think that he who had the power was divided as to the will.
How was it possible that he could stumble at such a choice?
What was money, position, land or inheritance compared to
simple, solid happiness?... He buried his face in the pillow,
and a kind of horror seized him at the cruel ways of things.
It was as if a bogey was in the room—the kind that used to be
there when he was a child, but no longer visible in the heeling
shadows round the nightlight, rather an invisible sickness, the
fetish of the Alards dancing in triumph over Stella and Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was strange that he should be so hurt by what was after
all not his tragedy—he was not really in love with Stella, only
felt that, given freedom for her and a few more years for him,
he could have been and would have been. And he was not
so much hurt as frightened. He was afraid because life
seemed to him at once so trivial and so gross. The things over
which people agonised were, after all, small shoddy things—earth
and halfpence; to see them have such power to crush
hopes and deform lives was like seeing a noble tree eaten up
by insects. In time he too would be eaten up&#160;... No, no!
He must save himself, somehow. He must find happiness
somewhere. But how?</p>

<p class='c015'>When he tried to think, he was afraid. He remembered
what he used to do in the old days when he was so dreadfully
afraid in this room. He used to draw up his knees to his chin
and pray—pray frantically in his fear. That was before he
had heard about the Ninety-nine Just Sheep being left for the
one that was lost; directly he had heard that story he had given
up saying his prayers, for fear he should be a Just Sheep, when
he would so much rather be the lost one, because the shepherd
loved it and had carried it in his arms.... He must have
been a queer sort of kid. Now all that was gone—religion&#160;... the school chapel, confirmation classes, manly Christians,
the Bishop’s sleeves&#160;... he could scarcely realise those dim
delicate raptures he had had as a child—his passionate interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>in that dear Friend and God walking the earth&#160;... all the
wonderful things he had pondered in his heart. Religion was
so different after you were grown up. It became an affair
of earth and halfpence like everything else.</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella’s religion still seemed to have some colour left in it,
some life, some youth. It was more like his childhood’s faith
than anything he had met so far. She had told him tonight
that there were two Christmas trees in church, one each side
of the Altar, all bright with the glass balls and birds that had
made his childhood’s Christmas trees seem almost supernatural....
Yggdrasils decked for the eternal Yule&#160;... he was falling
asleep.... He was sorry for Stella. She had told him
too about the Christmas Crib, the little straw house she had
built in the church for Mary and Joseph and the Baby, for the
ox and the ass and the shepherds and their dogs and the lambs
they could not leave behind.... She had told him that she
never thought of Christ as being born in Bethlehem, but in the
barn at the back of the Plough Inn at Udimore.... He saw
the long road running into the sunrise, wet and shining, red
with an angry morning. Someone was coming along it carrying
a lamb&#160;... was it the lost sheep—or just one of the lambs
the shepherds could not leave behind?&#160;... all along the road
the trees were hung with glass balls and many-coloured birds.
He could feel Stella beside him, though he could not see her.
She was trying to make him come with her to the inn. She
was saying “Come, Peter—oh, do come, Peter,” and he seemed
to be Peter going with her. Then suddenly he knew he was
not Peter, and the earth roared and the trees flew up into the
sky, which shook and flamed.... He must be falling asleep.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 13</h3>

<p class='c014'>Gervase’s feelings towards Alard being what they were, anybody
might wonder he should think of giving up Oxford for
the family’s sake. Indeed, he almost changed his mind in the
throes of that wakeful, resentful night, and resolved to take
his expensive way to Christ’s or Balliol. But by morning he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>had come to see himself more clearly and to laugh at his own
pretences. He wasn’t “giving up” Oxford—he didn’t want to
go there—he had always shrunk from the thought of Oxford
life with its patterns and conventions—and then at the end of
it he would still be his father’s youngest son, drawing a
youngest son’s allowance from depleted coffers. He would far
rather learn his job as an engineer and win an early independence.
Going to his work every morning, meeting all sorts
of men, rough and smooth, no longer feeling irrevocably shut up
in a class, a cult, a tradition&#160;... in that way he might really
win freedom and defy the house of Alard. “My name’s Gervase
Alard,” he said to himself—“and I’m damned if Gervase shall
be sacrificed to Alard, for he’s the most important of the two.”</p>

<p class='c015'>If only he could persuade his father to see as he saw—not
quite, of course, but near enough to let him make a start.
Peter had not seen very well, still he had nearly agreed when
the argument was broken up. Sir John must be found in a
propitious hour.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next day provided none such, for Christmas had not
unexpectedly brought a return of the Squire’s twinges, but
these passed off with unusual quickness, and on Innocents’ Day
his indomitable pluck mounted him once again on his grey horse
to ride round the farms. Gervase found him finishing his
breakfast when he came down for his own, and seeing by whip
and gaiters what was planned, he realised that a favourable
time had come. So he rushed into his request while he was
helping himself to bacon.</p>

<p class='c015'>To his surprise his father heard him without interruption.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you any bent for engineering?” he asked at the end.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, yes, Sir. I can drive any sort of car and mess about
with their insides. I always was keen.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ve been keen on a good many things if I remember
right, but not always proficient. All my sons have been to
Oxford.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But think what a lot it ’ud cost you, Sir, to send me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I expect it ’ud cost me nearly as much to make an engineer
of you.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Oh, no, Sir—you’ll only have to plank down about a hundred
to start with, and in time they’ll pay me some sort of a
screw. And if I go into a shop at Ashford I can live at home
and cost you nothing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You think you’ll cost nothing to keep at home? What ull
you live on, you damned fool?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, relatively I meant, Sir. And if I get, say, fifteen bob
a week, as I shall in time....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’ll be a proud day for me, of course.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Things have changed since the war, and lots of chaps who’d
have gone up to the ’Varsity now go straight into works—there’s
Hugh’s friend, Tom Daubernon, opened a garage at
Colchester....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That will be your ambition in life—to open a garage?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, Sir—Alard and Co., motor-engineers and armament
makers—that’s my job, and not so bad either. Think of
Krupps.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir John laughed half angrily.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You impudent rascal! Have it your own way—after all,
it’ll suit me better to pay down a hundred for you to cover
yourself with oil and grease than a thousand for you to get
drunk two nights a week at Oxford”&#160;... a remark which
affected Gervase in much the same way as the remark on
“little women” had affected Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>The conversation was given a more romantic colour when
Sir John retailed it to Peter on the edge of the big ploughed
field by Glasseye Farm. Peter was going out after duck on
the Tillingham marshes—he had that particularly solitary look
of a man who is out alone with a gun.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I must say I think the boy has behaved extremely well,”
said his father—“it must have cost him a lot to give up
Oxford. He thinks more of our position than I imagined.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t see that it’ll add much to the dignity of our position
to have him in a workshop.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It mayn’t add much to our dignity—but he’s only the
youngest son. And what we want more than dignity is
money.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“Gervase giving up Oxford won’t save you more than a few
hundred, and what’s that when it’ll take fifty thousand to pay
off the mortgages?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re a sulky dog, Peter,” said Sir John. “If you’d only
do as well as your brother, perhaps you could pull us out of
this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What d’you mean, Sir?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase has done his best and given up the only thing he
had to give up—Oxford. If you could sink your personal
wishes for the family’s sake....”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter turned crimson and his pale Saxon eyes darkened
curiously.</p>

<p class='c015'>“D’you know what I mean?” continued his father.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mean marry a rich woman&#160;... you want me to marry
Dolly Hurst.”</p>

<p class='c015'>For a moment Sir John was silent, then he said in an unexpectedly
controlled voice——</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, what’s wrong with Dolly Hurst?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nothing that I know of&#160;... but then I know nothing&#160;...
and I don’t care.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m told,” continued the baronet, still calmly, “that you
have already formed an attachment.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Who told you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Never mind who. The point is, I understand there is such
an attachment.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter sought for words and found none. While he was still
seeking, Sir John shook the reins, and the grey horse moved
off heavily up the side of the field.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 14</h3>

<p class='c014'>On the spur of the hill below Barline stands that queer
edifice known as Mocksteeple. It has from the distance a
decided look of a steeple, its tarred cone being visible for many
miles down the river Tillingham. It was built early in the
eighteenth century by an eccentric Sir Giles Alard, brother of
non-juring Gervase and buyer of Starvecrow. A man of gallantries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>he required a spot at which to meet his lady friends,
and raised up Mocksteeple for their accommodation—displaying
a fine cynicism both towards the neighbours’ opinion—for
his tryst was a landmark to all the district—and towards the
ladies themselves, whose comforts could have been but
meagrely supplied in its bare, funnel-shaped interior.</p>

<p class='c015'>Today it had sunk to a store-house and was full of hop-poles
when Peter approached it from the marshes and sat down to
eat his sandwiches in the sunshine that, even on a December
day, had power to draw a smell of tar from its walls. At his
feet squatted the spaniel Breezy, with sentimental eyes fixed
on Peter’s gun and the brace of duck that lay beside it. Peter’s
boots and leggings were caked with mud, and his hands were
cold as they fumbled with his sandwiches. It was not a good
day to have lunch out of doors, even in that tar-smelling sunshine,
but anything was better than facing the family round
the table at Conster—their questions, their comments, their
inane remarks....</p>

<p class='c015'>It was queer how individually and separately his family
irritated him, whereas collectively they were terrible with
banners. His father, his mother, Doris, Jenny, George, Gervase—so
much tyranny, so much annoyance&#160;... the Family—a
war-cry, a consecration. It was probably because the Family
did not merely stand for those at Conster now, but for Alards
dead and gone, from the first Gervase to the last, a whole
communion of saints.... If Conster had to be sold, or
stripped to its bare bones, it would not be only the family now
sitting at luncheon that would rise and upbraid him, but all
those who slept in Leasan churchyard and in the south aisle
at Winchelsea.</p>

<p class='c015'>Beside him, facing them all, would stand only one small
woman. Would her presence be enough to support him when
all those forefathers were dishonoured, all those dear places
reproached him?—Glasseye, Barline, Dinglesden, Snailham,
Ellenwhorne, Starvecrow&#160;... torn away from the central
heart and become separate spoil&#160;... just for Stella, whom
he had loved only a year.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Leaning against the wall of the Mocksteeple, Peter seemed
to hear the voice of the old ruffian who had built it speaking
to him out of the tar—deriding him because he would take
love for life and house it in a Manor, whereas love is best
when taken for a week and housed in any convenient spot.
But Peter had never been able to take love for a week. Even
when he had had adventures he had taken them seriously—those
independent, experience-hunting young women of his
own class who had filled the place in his life which “little
women” and “French dancers” had filled in his father’s. They
had always found old Peter embarrassingly faithful when they
changed their minds.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now at last he had found love, true love, in which he could
stay all his life—a shelter, a house, a home like Starvecrow.
He would be a fool to renounce it—and there was Stella to be
thought of too; he did not doubt her love for him, she would
not change. Their friendship had started in the troublesome
times of war and he had given her to understand that he could
not marry till the war was over. Those unsettled conditions
which had just the opposite effect on most men, making them
jump into marriage, snatch their happiness from under the
cannon wheels, had made Peter shrink from raising a permanent
relation in the midst of so much chaos. Marriage, in
his eyes, was settling down, a state to be entered into deliberately,
with much background.... And Stella had agreed,
with her lips at least, though what her heart had said was
another matter.</p>

<p class='c015'>But now the war was over, he was at home, the background
was ready—she would expect.... Already he was conscious
of a sharp sense of treachery. At the beginning of their love,
Hugh had been alive and the Alard fortunes no direct concern
of Peter’s—he had expected to go back into business and marry
Stella on fifteen hundred a year. But ever since Hugh’s death
he had realised that things would be different—and he had not
told her. Naturally she would think his prospects improved—and
he had not undeceived her, though on his last leave, nine
months ago, he had guessed the bad way things were going.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>He had not behaved well to her, and it was now his duty to
put matters right at once, to tell her of his choice&#160;... if he
meant to choose.... Good God! he didn’t even know yet
what he ought to do—even what he wanted to do. If he lost
Stella he lost joy, warmth, laughter, love, the last of youth—if
he lost Alard he lost the First and Last Things of his life,
the very rock on which it stood. There was much in Stella
which jarred him, which made him doubt the possibility of
running in easy yoke with her, which made him fear that
choosing her might lead to failure and regret. But also there
was much in Alard which fell short of perfection—it had an
awkward habit of splitting up into its component parts, into
individuals, every separate one of which hurt and vexed. That
way, too, might lead to emptiness. It seemed that whichever
choice he made he failed somebody and ran the risk of a vain
sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c015'>But he must decide. He must not hold Stella now if he did
not mean to hold her forever. He saw that. His choice must
be made at once, for her sake, not in some dim, drifting future
as he had at first imagined. He was not going to marry the
Hurst girl—he almost hated her—and to marry a girl for her
money was like prostitution, even though the money was to
save not him but his. But if he was not going to marry Stella
he must act immediately. He had no right to keep her half
bound now that the time had come to take her entirely. Oh,
Stella!...</p>

<p class='c015'>Breezy the spaniel came walking over Peter’s legs, and licked
his hands in which his face was hidden.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 15</h3>

<p class='c014'>That night Peter wrote to Stella:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>My own dear</em>—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>I’ve been thinking about you all today—I’ve been thinking
about you terribly. I took my gun out this morning after
duck, but I had a rotten day because I was thinking of you all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the time. I had lunch down by the Mocksteeple, and Stella,
I wanted you so that I could have cried. Then afterwards
when I was at home I wanted you. I went in to Lambard and
we cut some pales, but all the time I was thinking of you. And
now I can think no longer—I must write and tell you what
I’ve thought.</p>

<p class='c018'>Child, I want to marry you. You’ve known that for a long
time, haven’t you? But I wanted to wait till the end of the
war. I don’t believe in marrying a girl and then going out
and getting killed, though that is what a lot of chaps did. Well,
anyhow the war’s over. So will you marry me, Stella child?
But I must tell you this. My people will be dead against it,
because they’re looking to me to save the family by making a
rich marriage. It sounds dreadful, but it’s not really so bad
as it sounds, because if we don’t pick up somehow we shall
probably go smash and lose almost everything, including Starvecrow.
But I don’t care. I love you better than anything in
the world. Only I must prepare you for having to marry me
quietly somewhere and living with me in London for a bit.
My father won’t have me as agent, I’m quite sure, if I do
this, but perhaps he’ll come round after a time. Anyhow
Stella, darling, if we have each other, the rest won’t matter,
will it? What does it matter even if we have to sell our land
and go out of Conster? They’ve got no real claim on me.
Let Jenny marry somebody rich, or Doris—it’s not too late.
But I don’t see why I should sacrifice my life to the family,
and yours too, darling child. For I couldn’t do this if I didn’t
believe that you love me as much as I love you.</p>

<p class='c018'>I think this is the longest letter than I have ever written to
you, but then it is so important. Dearest, we must meet and
talk things over. The Greenings are going into Hastings on
Tuesday to look at a house, so will you come to me at Starvecrow?</p>

<p class='c018'>My kisses, you sweet, and all my love.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; <span class='sc'>Peter.</span></p>

<p class='c015'>It was nearly midnight when he had finished writing at the
table in his bedroom. He folded up the letter and slipped it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>under the blotting paper, before getting into bed and sleeping
soundly.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the next morning he tore it to pieces.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 16</h3>

<p class='c014'>On the last day of the old year Mary Pembroke came down
to Conster Manor, arriving expensively with a great deal of
luggage. Her beauty was altogether of a more sophisticated
kind than Jenny’s and more exotic than Doris’s—which, though
at thirty-eight extinct in the realm of nature, still lived in the
realm of art. Mary was thirty-one, tall and supple, with an
arresting fineness about her, and a vibrant, ardent quality.</p>

<p class='c015'>The family was a little restless as they surrounded her in
the drawing-room at tea. She had that same element of
unexpectedness as Gervase, but with the difference that Gervase
was as yet raw and young and under control. Mary
gave an impression of being more grown up than anyone, even
than Lady Alard and Sir John; life with her was altogether a
more acute affair.</p>

<p class='c015'>Only Lady Alard enquired after the absent Julian.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wonder he didn’t come down with you,” she murmured.
“I sent him a very special invitation.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Bah!” said Sir John.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why do you say ‘Bah,’ dear?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Doris, tell your mother why I said ‘Bah.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Father, how do I know?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You must be very stupid, then. I give leave to any one
of you to explain why I said ‘Bah,’” and Sir John stumped
out of the room.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Really, your father is impossible,” sighed Lady Alard.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary did not talk much—her tongue skimmed the surface of
Christmas: the dances they had been to, the people they had
had to dinner. She looked fagged and anxious—strung. At
her first opportunity she went upstairs to take off her travelling
clothes and dress for dinner. Of dressing and undressing
Mary made always a lovely ceremony—very different from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Jenny’s hasty scuffle and Doris’s veiled mysteries. She lingered
over it as over a thing she loved; and Jenny loved to
watch her—all the careful, charming details, the graceful
acts and poses, the sweet scents. Mary moved like the priest
of her own beauty, with her dressing table for altar and her
maid for acolyte—the latter an olive-skinned French girl,
who with a topknot of black hair gave a touch of chinoiserie
to the proceedings.</p>

<p class='c015'>When Mary had slipped off her travelling dress, and wrapped
in a Mandarin’s coat of black and rose and gold, had let
Gisèle unpin her hair, she sent the girl away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je prendrai mon bain à sept heures—vous reviendrez.</span>”</p>

<p class='c015'>She leaned back in her armchair, her delicate bare ankles
crossed, her feet in their brocade mules resting on the fender,
and gazed into the fire. Jenny moved about the room for a
few moments, looking at brushes and boxes and jars. She
had always been more Mary’s friend than Doris, whose attitude
had that peculiar savour of the elder, unmarried sister
towards the younger married one. But Jenny with Mary
was not the same as Jenny with Gervase—her youth easily
took colour from its surroundings, and with Mary she was
less frank, more hushed, more unquiet. When she had done
looking at her things, she came and sat down opposite her on
the other side of the fire.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well—how’s life?” asked Mary.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, pretty dull.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What, no excitements? How’s Jim?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, just the same as usual. He hangs about, but he
knows it’s no good, and so do I—and he knows that I know
it’s no good, and I know that he knows that I know—” and
Jenny laughed wryly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hasn’t he any prospects?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“None whatever—at least none that are called prospects
in our set, though I expect they’d sound pretty fine to anyone
else. He’ll have Cock Marling when his father dies.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You shouldn’t have fallen in love with a landed proprietor,
Jen.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Oh, well, it’s done now and I can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You don’t sound infatuated.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not, but I’m in love right enough. It’s all the hanging
about and uncertainty that makes me sound bored—in self-defence
one has to grow a thick skin.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary did not speak for a moment but seemed to slip
through the firelight into a dream.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” she said at last—“a thick skin or a hard heart. If
the average woman’s heart could be looked at under a microscope
I expect it would be seen to be covered with little
spikes and scales and callouses—a regular hard heart. Or
perhaps it would be inflamed and tender&#160;... I believe inflammation
is a defence, against disease—or poison. But after all,
nothing’s much good—the enemy always gets his knife in
somehow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She turned away her eyes from Jenny, and the younger
sister felt abashed—and just because she was abashed and
awkward and shy, for that very reason, she blurted out——</p>

<p class='c015'>“How’s Julian?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, quite well, thank you. I persuaded him not to come
down because he and father always get on so badly.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s a pity they do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“A very great pity. But I can’t help it. I did my best to
persuade him to advance the money, but he’s not a man who’ll
lend without good security, even to a relation. I’m sorry,
because if he would stand by the family, I shouldn’t feel I’d
been quite such a fool to marry him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Though the fiction of Mary being happily married was
kept up only by Lady Alard, it gave Jenny a faint shock to
hear her sister speak openly of failure. Her feelings of
awkwardness and shyness returned, and a deep colour stained
her cheeks. What should you say?—should you take any
notice?... It was your sister.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mary, have you&#160;... are you&#160;... I mean, is it
really quite hopeless?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, quite,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then what are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“I don’t know—I haven’t thought.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny crossed and uncrossed her large feet—she looked
at her sister’s little mules, motionless upon the fender.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is he—I mean, does he—treat you badly?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary laughed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, no—husbands in our class don’t as a rule, unless they’re
qualifying for statutory cruelty. Julian isn’t cruel—he’s
very kind—indeed probably most people would say he was a
model husband. I simply can’t endure him, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Incompatibility of temperament.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s a very fine name for it, but I daresay it’s the right
one. Julian and I are two different sorts of people, and
we’ve found it out—at least I have. Also he’s disappointed
because we’ve been married seven years and I haven’t had
a child—and he lets me see he’s disappointed. And now he’s
begun to be jealous—that’s put the lid on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She leaned back in her chair, her hands folded on her lap,
without movement and yet, it seemed, without rest. Her
body was alert and strung, and her motionlessness was that
of a taut bowstring or a watching animal. As Jenny’s eyes
swept over her, taking in both her vitality and her immaculacy,
a new conjecture seized her, a sudden question.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mary—are you&#160;... are you in love?—with someone
else, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—what makes you think so?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s how you look.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jen, you’re not old enough yet to know how a woman
looks when she’s in love. Your own face in the glass won’t
tell you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s not your face—it’s the way you behave—the way
you dress. You seem to worship yourself....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So you think I must be in love—you can’t conceive that
my efforts to be beautiful should be inspired by anything
but the wish to please some man! Jen, you’re like all men,
but, I’d hoped, only a few women—you can’t imagine a woman
wanting to be beautiful for her own sake. Oh, my dear,
it’s just because I’m not in love that I must please myself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>If I was in love I shouldn’t bother half so much—I’d know
I pleased somebody else, which one can do with much less
trouble than one can please oneself. I shouldn’t bother about
my own exactions any more. The day you see me with untidy
hair and an unpowdered skin you’ll know I’m in love with
somebody who loves me, and haven’t got to please myself any
more.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Mary&#160;... there’s Charles. Don’t you love
Charles?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I don’t. I know it’s very silly of me not to love the
man my husband’s jealous of, but such is the fact. Nobody
but Julian would have made a row about Charles—he’s just
a pleasant, well-bred, oldish man, who’s simple enough to be
restful. He’s more than twenty years older than I am, which
I know isn’t everything, but counts for a good deal. I liked
going about with him because he’s so remote from all the
fatigue and fret and worry of that side of life. It was almost
like going about with another woman, except that one had the
advantage of a man’s protection and point of view.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Does he love you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t think so for a moment. In fact I’m quite sure he
doesn’t. He likes taking out a pretty woman, and we’ve
enough differences to make us interesting to each other, but
there the matter ends. As it happens, I’m much too fond of
him to fall in love with him. It’s not a thing I’d ever do with
a man I liked as a friend. I know what love is, you see, and
not so long ago.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Who was that?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Julian,” said Mary dryly.</p>

<p class='c015'>A feeling of panic and hopelessness came over Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, God&#160;... then one can never know.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 17</h3>

<p class='c014'>Gervase’s scheme of going into a workshop materialised
more quickly than his family, knowing his rather inconsequent
nature, had expected. The very day after he had obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>his father’s consent he drove into Ashford and interviewed
the manager of Messrs. Gillingham and Golightly, motor
engineers in the station road. After some discussion it was
arranged that he should be taken into the works as pupil
on the payment of a premium of seventy-five pounds to cover
three years’ instruction, during which time he was to receive
a salary starting at five shillings a week and rising to fifteen.</p>

<p class='c015'>The sarcasm that greeted his first return on Saturday afternoon
with his five shillings in his pocket was equalled only
by his own pride. Here at last was money of his own,
genuinely earned and worked for—money that was not Alard’s,
that was undimmed by earth, having no connection with the
land either through agriculture or landlordism. Gervase
felt free for at least an hour.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We can launch out a bit now,” said Sir John at luncheon—“Gervase
has come to our rescue and is supporting us in our
hour of need. Which shall we pay off first, Peter?—Stonelink
or Dinglesden?...”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter scowled—he seemed to find his father’s pleasantry
more offensive than Gervase, who merely laughed and jingled
the coins in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c015'>The youngest Alard threw himself with zest into his new
life. It certainly was a life which required enthusiasm to
make it worth living. Every morning at nine he had to be at
the works, driving himself in the Ford farm-lorry, which had
been given over to his use on its supplanting by a more recent
make. He often was not back till seven or eight at night,
worn out, but with that same swelling sense of triumph with
which he had returned from his first day’s work. He was
still living at home, still dependent on his people for food
and clothing if not for pocket money, but his feet were set
on a road which would take him away from Conster, out of
the Alard shadow. Thank God! he was the youngest son, or
they wouldn’t have let him go. He enjoyed the hardness
of the way—the mortification of those early risings, with the
blue, star-pricked sky and the deadly cold—the rattling drive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>in the Ford through all weathers—the arrival at the works,
the dirt, the din, the grease, the breaking of his nails, his
filthy overalls, his fellow workmen with their unfamiliar oaths
and class-grievances, the pottering over bolts and screws,
the foreman’s impatience with his natural carelessness—the
exhausted drive home over the darkness of the Kent road&#160;... Gable Hook, Tenterden, Newenden, Northiam, Beckley,
going by in a flash of red windows—the arrival at Conster
almost too tired to eat—the welcome haven of bed and the
all too short sweet sleep.</p>

<p class='c015'>Those January days in their zeal and discipline were like
the first days of faith—life ceased to be an objectless round,
a slavery to circumstances. Generally when he was at home
he was acutely sensitive to the fret of Conster, to the ceaseless
fermentation of those lives, so much in conflict and yet
so combined—he had always found his holidays depressing
and been glad to go back to school. Now, though he still
lived in the house, he did not belong to it—its ambitions and
its strife did not concern him, though he was too observant
and sensitive not to be affected by what was going on.</p>

<p class='c015'>He saw enough to realise that the two main points of tension
were Mary and Peter. Mary was still at Conster, though
he understood that Julian had written asking her to come
home—February was near, and she stayed on, though she
spoke of going back. As for Peter, he had become sulky and
self-absorbed. He would not go for walks on Sundays, or
shooting on Saturday afternoons—he had all the painful,
struggling manner of a plain man with a secret—a straightforward
man in the knots of a decision. Gervase was sorry
for him, but a little angry too. Over his more monotonous
jobs at the works, in his rare wakeful moments, but most of
all in his long familiar-contemptible drives to and from Ashford,
he still thought of Stella. His feeling for her remained
much the same as it had been at Christmas—a loving absorption,
a warm worship. He could not bear that she should
suffer—she was so very much alive that he felt her suffering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>must be sharper than other people’s. He could guess
by his own feelings a little of what she suffered in her love
for Peter—and once he got further than a guess.</p>

<p class='c015'>During those weeks he had never met her anywhere, either
at Conster or outside it; but one Saturday at noon, as he
was coming away from the shop, he met her surprisingly on
foot in the station road. He pulled up and spoke to her, and
she told him she was on her way to the station in hopes of
an early train. The Singer had broken down with magneto
trouble and she had been obliged to leave it for repair—meantime
her father wanted her back early, as there was
always a lot of dispensary work to do on a Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, if you don’t mind a ride in a dying Ford....”</p>

<p class='c015'>He hardly dared listen to her answer, he tried to read it
as it came into her eyes while he spoke.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course I don’t mind. I should love it—and it’s really
most frightfully good of you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So she climbed up beside him, and soon her round bright
eyes were looking at him from between her fur cap and huge
fur collar, as they had looked that first morning at Starvecrow....
He felt the love rising in his throat&#160;... tender
and silly&#160;... he could not speak; and he soon found
that she would rather he didn’t. Not only was the Ford’s
death-rattle rather loud but she seemed to find the same encouragement
to thought as he in that long monotonous jolt
through the Weald of Kent. He did not have to lift himself
far out of the stream of his thoughts when he looked at
her or spoke, but hers were evidently very far away. With
a strange mixture of melancholy and satisfaction, he realised
that he must count for little in her life—practically nothing
at all. Even if she were not Peter’s claim she could never
be his—not only on account of her age, six years older than
he, but because the fact that she loved Peter showed that it
was unlikely she could ever love Gervase, Peter’s contrast....
In his heart was a sweet ache of sorrow, the thrill
which comes with the first love-pain.</p>

<p class='c015'>But as they ran down into Sussex, across the floods that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>sheeted the Rother levels, and saw the first outposts of Alard-Monking
and Horns Cross Farms with the ragged line of
Moat Wood—his heart suddenly grew cold. In one of his
sidelong glances at Stella he saw a tear hanging on the dark
stamen of an eyelash&#160;... he looked again as soon as he
dared, and saw another on her cheek. Was it the cold?...</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella, are you cold?” he asked, fearing her answer.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, thank you, Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He dared not ask “Why are you crying?” Also there was
no need—he knew. The sweetness had gone out of his sorrow,
he no longer felt that luxurious creep of pain—instead
his heart was heavy, and dragged at his breast. It was faint
with anger.</p>

<p class='c015'>When they came to the Throws where the road to Vinehall
turns out of the road to Leasan, he asked her if she
wouldn’t come up to Conster for tea—“and I’ll drive you home
afterwards.” But again she said in her gentle voice “No
thank you, Gervase.” He wished she wouldn’t say it like
that.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 18</h3>

<p class='c014'>What did Peter mean?</p>

<p class='c015'>That was the question Stella had asked herself at intervals
during the past month, that she had been asking herself all
the way from Ashford to Vinehall, and was still asking
when Gervase set her down on the doorstep of Hollingrove
and drove away. What did Peter mean?</p>

<p class='c015'>She would not believe that he meant nothing—that their
friendship had been just one of those war-time flirtations
which must fade in the light of peace. It had lasted too long,
for one thing—it had lasted a year. For a whole year they
had loved each other, written to each other almost every day,
hungered for meetings, and met with kisses and passionate
playful words. It is true that he had never spoken to her of
marriage except negatively, but she knew his views and had
submitted if not agreed. All that was over now—he was no
longer a soldier, holding his life on an uncertain lease; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>more, he was now the heir—their prospects had improved
from the material and practical point of view. He might,
like so many men, have found it difficult to get back into business,
recover his pre-war footing in the world; but there need
be no concern for that now—he was not only the heir, but his
father’s agent, already established with home and income,
and his home that dearest of all places, Starvecrow....</p>

<p class='c015'>She would not believe that he had been playing with her,
that he had only taken her to pass the time, and now was
looking for some decent pretext for letting her go. He was
not that sort of man at all. Peter was loyal and honest right
through. Besides, she saw no sign that his love had grown
cold. She was sure that he loved her as much as ever, but
more painfully, more doubtingly. Their meetings had lately
been given over to a sorrowful silence. He had held her in
his arms in silent, straining tenderness. He would not talk,
he would not smile. What did he mean?</p>

<p class='c015'>Probably his family was making trouble. She had been
only once to Conster since she had dined there on Christmas
Day, and it had struck her then that Doris and Lady Alard
had both seemed a little unfriendly. Everyone in Leasan
and Vinehall said that the Squire’s son would have to marry
money if he meant to keep the property going. She had
often heard people say that—but till now she had scarcely
thought of it. The idea had seemed impossible, almost
grotesque. But now it did not seem quite impossible—Peter’s
behaviour, his family’s behaviour, all pointed to its being a
factor in the situation; and since she could not refuse to see
that something was keeping him silent when he ought to
speak, it was easier to believe in a difficulty of this kind than
in any commonplace cooling or change. Once she had thought
that nothing, not even Alard, could come between them—now
she must alter her faith to the extent of believing that nothing
could come between them except Alard.</p>

<p class='c015'>She could not help being a little angry with Peter for this
discovery. It seemed to her a shameful thing that money
should count against love. As for herself, she did not dare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>think what she would not sacrifice for love—for Peter if
occasion arose. And he, apparently, would not sacrifice for
her one acre of Conster, one tile of Starvecrow.... Was
it the difference between men and women which made the difference
here? If she was a man would she be able to see
the importance of Peter’s family, the importance of keeping
his property together even at the expense of happiness and
faith? She wondered.... Meanwhile she was angry.</p>

<p class='c015'>She wished he would have things out with her, try to explain.
That he did not was probably due to the mixture of
that male cowardice which dreads a “scene” with that male
stupidity which imagines that nothing has been noticed which
it has not chosen to reveal. But if he didn’t tell her soon she
would ask him herself. She knew that such a step was not
consistent with feminine dignity either ancient or modern.
According to tradition she should have drooped to the masculine
whim, according to fashion she should have asserted
her indifference to it. But she could do neither. She could
not bear her own uncertainty any longer—this fear of her
hopes. Oh, she had planned so materially and wildly! She
had planned the very furnishing of Starvecrow—which room
was to be which—the dining-room, the best bedroom, the
spare bedroom, Peter’s study&#160;... cream distemper on
the walls and for each room different colours&#160;... and a
kitchen furnished with natural oak and copper pots and
pans....</p>

<p class='c015'>The tears which up till now had only teased the back of
her eyes, brimmed over at the thought of the kitchen. The
dark January afternoon, clear under a sky full of unshed rain,
was swallowed up in mist as Stella wept for her kitchen and
copper pans.</p>

<p class='c015'>She was still on the doorstep, where she had stood to see
the last of Gervase, and even now that she was crying she
did not turn into the house. The iron-black road was empty
between its draggled hedges, and she found a certain kinship
in the winter twilight, with its sharpness, its sighing of low,
rain-burdened winds. After a few moments she dried her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>eyes and went down the steps to the gate. Thanks to Gervase,
she had come home nearly an hour earlier than she
need—she would go and sit for a few minutes in church.
She found church a very good place for thinking her love
affairs into their right proportion with all time.</p>

<p class='c015'>The village of Vinehall was not like the village of Leasan,
which straggled for nearly a mile each side of the high road.
It was a large village, all pressed together like a little town.
Above it soared the spire of Vinehall church, which, like
many Sussex churches, stood in a farmyard. Its lovely image
lay in the farmyard pond, streaked over with green scum and
the little eddies that followed the ducks.</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella carefully shut out a pursuing hen and went in by the
tower door. The church was full of heavy darkness. The
afternoon sun had left it a quarter of an hour ago, showing
only its pale retreat through the slats of the clerestory windows,
white overhead, and night lay already in the aisles.
She groped her way to the east end, where the white star of
a lamp flickered against a pillar guarding a shrine. She
flopped down on the worn stones at the foot of the pillar, sitting
back on her heels, her hands lying loosely and meekly in
her lap.</p>

<p class='c015'>She had no sense of loneliness or fear in the dark—the
white lamp spoke to her of a presence which she could feel
throughout the dark and empty church, a presence of living
quiet, of glowing peace. Outside she could hear the fowls
ducking in the yard, with every now and then the shrill gobble-gobble
of a turkey. She loved these homely sounds, which
for years had been the accompaniment of her prayers—her
prayers which had no words, but seemed to move in her heart
like flames. Oh, it was good to be here, to have this place to
come to, this Presence to seek.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now that she was here she could no longer feel angry
with Peter, however stupid, obstinate and earthy he was.
Poor Peter—choosing it for himself as well as for her&#160;...
she could not be angry with him, because she knew that if he
pulled catastrophe down upon them, he of the two would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>suffer the most. Unlike her, he had no refuge, no Presence
to seek, no unseen world that could become real at a thought....
His gods were dead Squires who had laid up wealth
to be his poverty. Her God was a God who had beggared
Himself, that she through His poverty might become rich.</p>

<p class='c015'>This beggar and lover and prisoner, her God, was with her
here in the darkness, telling her that if she too wished to be
a lover she too must become a beggar and a prisoner. She
would be Peter’s beggar, Peter’s slave. She would not let him
go from her without pleading, without fighting, but if he
really must go, if this half-known monster, Alard, was really
strong enough to take him, he should not go wounded by her
detaining clutch as well as by its claws. He should not go
shamed and reproached, but with goodwill. If he really
must go, and she could no longer hold him, she would make
his going easy.... He should go in peace....
Poor Peter.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 19</h3>

<p class='c014'>At the end of January Mary left Conster. She could not
in any spirit of decorum put off her return longer—her husband
had wired to her to come home.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Poor Julian,” said Lady Alard—“he must be missing you
dreadfully. I really think you ought to go back, Mary, since
he can’t manage to come here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary agreed without elaboration, and her lovely hats and
shoes with the tea-gowns and dinner-frocks which had divided
the family into camps of admiration and disapproval, were
packed away by the careful, brisk Gisèle. The next day she
was driven over to Ashford, with Jenny and Peter to see her
off.</p>

<p class='c015'>There had been no intimate talks between the sisters since
the first night of her coming. Jenny was shy, and typically
English in her dislike of the exposure of anything which
seemed as if it ought to be hidden, and Mary either felt
this attitude in her sister or else shrank from disillusioning
her youth still further. They had arrived a little too early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>for the train, and stood together uneasily on the platform
while Gisèle bought the tickets and superintended the luggage.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wish you didn’t have to go,” said Jenny politely.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So do I—but it couldn’t be helped after that telegram.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Julian sounded rather annoyed—I hope he won’t make
a fuss when you get back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not going back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a heavy silence. Neither Peter nor Jenny thought
they had quite understood.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wh-what do you mean?” stammered Jenny at last—“not
going back to Chart? Isn’t Julian there?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course he’s there. That’s why I’m not going back.
Gisèle is taking the tickets to London.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But”—It was Peter who said ‘But,’ and had apparently
nothing else to say.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you mean that you’re leaving him?” faltered Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not going to live with him any more. I’ve had
enough.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But why didn’t you tell us?—tell the parents?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d rather not bring the family into it. It’s my own choice
though Julian is sure to think you’ve been influencing me.
I didn’t make up my mind till I got his telegram; then I saw
quite plainly that I couldn’t go back to him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re not going to that other fellow—what’s his name—Commander
Smith?” cried Peter, finding his tongue rather
jerkily.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, no. As I’ve told Jenny, making a mess of things with
one man doesn’t necessarily encourage me to try my luck
with another. Besides, I’m not fond of Charles—in that
way. I shall probably stay at my Club for a bit, and then
go abroad.... I don’t know.... All I know is
that I’m not going back to Julian.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Shall you—can you divorce him?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No. He hasn’t been cruel or unfaithful, nor has he deserted
me. I’m deserting him. It’s simply that I can’t live
with him—he gets on my nerves—I can’t put up with either
his love or his jealousy. I couldn’t bear the thought even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of having dinner with him tonight&#160;... and yet—”
the calm voice suddenly broke—“and yet I married for
love....”</p>

<p class='c015'>Both the brother and sister were silent. Peter saw Gisèle
coming up with a porter and the luggage, and went off like
a coward to meet them. Jenny remained uneasily with Mary.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sorry to have had to do this,” continued the elder
sister—“it’ll upset the parents, I know. They don’t like
Julian, but they’ll like a scandal still less.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you think he’ll make a row?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sure of it. For one thing, he’ll never think for a
minute I haven’t left him for someone else—for Charles.
He won’t be able to imagine that I’ve left a comfortable home
and a rich husband without any counter attraction except
my freedom. By the way, I shall be rather badly off—I’ll
have only my settlements, and they won’t bring in much.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Mary—do you really think you’re wise?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not wise, perhaps—nor good.” She pulled down her veil.
“I feel that a better or a worse woman would have made a
neater job of this. The worse would have found an easier
way—the better would have stuck to the rough. But I—oh,
I’m neither—I’m neither good nor bad. All I know is that
I can’t go back to Julian, to put up with his fussing and his
love and his suspicion—and, worse still, with my own shame
because I don’t love him any more—because I’ve allowed
myself to be driven out of love by tricks—by manner—by
outside things.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“—London train—Headcorn, Tonbridge and London
train—”</p>

<p class='c015'>The porter’s shouting was a welcome interruption, though
it made Jenny realise with a blank feeling of anxiety and
impotence that any time for persuasion was at an end.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you want us to tell Father and Mother?” she asked as
Mary got into the train.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You needn’t if you’d rather not. I’ll write to them tonight.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She leaned back in the carriage, soft, elegant, perfumed, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>little unreal, and yet conveying somehow a sense of desperate
choice and mortal straits.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter and Jenny scarcely spoke till they were back in the
car driving homewards. Then Jenny said with a little gasp—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Isn’t it dreadful?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What?—her going away?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, the fact that she married Julian for love.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter said nothing.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If she’d married out of vanity, or greed, or to please the
family, it would have been better—one would have understood
what’s happened now. But she married him for love.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter still said nothing.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 20</h3>

<p class='c014'>He sat waiting at Starvecrow on an early day in February.
Outside the rain kept the Feast of the Purification, washing
down the gutters of Starvecrow’s mighty roof, lapping the
edges of the pond into the yard, and further away transforming
all the valley of the Tillingham into a lake—huge sheets
and spreads of water, out of which the hills of Barline and
Brede Eye stood like a coast. All the air was fresh and
washed and tinkling with rain.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fire was piled high with great logs and posts, burning
with a blue flame, for they had been pulled out of the barns
of Starvecrow, which like many in the district were built of
ships’ timbers with the salt still in them. The sound of the
fire was as loud as the sound of the rain. Both made a sorrowful
music together in Peter’s head.</p>

<p class='c015'>He sat with his hands folded together under his chin, his
large light blue eyes staring without seeing into the grey
dripping world framed by the window. The clock in the passage
struck three. Stella would not come till a quarter past.
He had arranged things purposely so that he should be alone
for a bit at Starvecrow before meeting her, strengthening himself
with the old loyalties to fight the brief, sweet faithfulness
of a year.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>He felt almost physically sick at the thought of what lay
before him, but he had made up his mind to go through with
it—it had got to be done; and it must be done in this way.
Oh, how he had longed to send Stella a letter, telling her
that they must never see each other again, begging her to go
away and spare him! But he knew that was a coward’s
escape—the least he owed her was an explanation face to face....
What a brute he had been to her! He had no right
to have won her love if he did not mean to keep it—and
though when he had first sought her he had thought himself
free to do so, he had behaved badly in not telling her of the
new difficulties created by his becoming the heir. It was not
that he had meant to hide things from her, but he had simply
shelved them in his own mind, hoping that “something would
turn up,” that Alard’s plight would not be as bad as he had
feared. Now he saw that it was infinitely worse—and he
was driven to a definite choice between his people and Stella.
If he married Stella he would have failed Alard—if he stood
by Alard he would have failed Stella. It was a cruel choice—between
the two things in the world that he loved best.
But he must make it now—he could not keep Stella hanging
on indefinitely any longer. Already he could see how uncertainty,
anxiety and disappointment were telling on her. She
was looking worn and dim. She had expected him, on his
return home after the wars, to proclaim their love publicly,
and he was still keeping it hidden, though the reasons he had
first given her for doing so were at an end. She was wondering
why he didn’t speak—she was hesitating whether she
should speak herself.... He guessed her struggle and
knew he must put an end to it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides, now at last his choice was made. He no longer
had any uncertainty, any coil of argument to encumber him.
Mary’s words on Ashford platform had finally settled his
difficulty—“And yet I married for love.” Seven years ago
Mary had loved this man from whom she was now escaping,
the very sight of whom in her home she could not bear. Love
was as uncertain as everything else—it came and it was gone.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Mary had once loved Julian as Peter now loved Stella—and
look at her!... Oh, you could never be sure. And there
was so much in Stella he was not sure of—and she might
change—he might change; only places never changed—were
always the same. Starvecrow would always be to him, whether
at eighteen, thirty-eight or eighty, the same Starvecrow....
How could he fail the centuries behind him for what might
not live more than a few years? How could he fail the faithful
place for that which had change for its essence and death
for its end?</p>

<p class='c015'>Far away he could hear the purring of a car—it drew
nearer, and Peter, clenching his hands, found the palms damp.
All his skin was hot and moist—oh, God, what had he to face?
The scene that was coming would be dreadful—he’d never
get through it unless Stella helped him, and he’d no right to
expect help from her. Here she was, driving in at the gate&#160;... outside the door&#160;... inside the room at last.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 21</h3>

<p class='c014'>He sought refuge in custom, and going up to her, laid his
hands on her shoulders and kissed her gravely. Then he
began to loosen the fur buttons of her big collar, but she put
up her hand and stopped him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—I’ll keep it on. I can’t stop long. Father’s waiting
for me at Barline.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s good of you to come—there’s something I’ve got to
say.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You want to tell me we must end it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He had not expected her to help him so quickly. Then
he suddenly realised that his letter had probably told her a
lot—his trouble must have crept between the lines—into the
lines&#160;... he wasn’t good at hiding things.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Stella.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He stood a few paces from her, and noticed—now that
his thoughts were less furiously concentrated on himself—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>she was white, that all the warm, rich colour in her
cheeks was gone. He pulled forward one of the office chairs,
and she sank into it. He sat down opposite her, and took her
hand, which she did not withdraw.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Stella, my darling&#160;... my precious child&#160;...
it’s all no use. I’ve hoped and I’ve tried, but it’s no good—I
must let you go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The word came almost sharply—she wasn’t going to help
him, then, so much.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Darling, I know I’m a cad. I ought never to have told
you I loved you, knowing that&#160;... at least when Hugh
died I should have told you straight out how things were.
But I couldn’t—I let myself drift, hoping matters would
improve&#160;... and then there was the war....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter, I wish you would tell me things straight out—now’s
better than never. And honestly I can’t understand why
you’re not going to marry me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He was a little shocked. Tradition taught him that Stella
would try to save her face, and he had half expected her to
say that she had never thought of marrying him. After all,
he had never definitely asked her, and she might claim that
this was only one of those passionate friendships which had
become so common during the war. If she had done so, he
would have conceded her the consolation without argument—a
girl ought to try and save her face; but Stella apparently did
not care about her face at all.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why aren’t you going to marry me? You’ve never given
me any real reason.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Surely you know”—his voice was a little cold.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How can I know? I see you the heir of a huge estate,
living in a big house with apparently lots of money. You tell
me again and again that you love me—I’m your equal in birth
and education. Why on earth should I ‘know’ that you can’t
marry me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella, we’re in an awful mess—all the family. The estate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>is mortgaged almost up to the last acre—we can hardly manage
to pay the yearly interest, and owing to the slump in
land we can’t sell.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella stared at him woodenly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Can’t you understand?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—” she said slowly—“I can’t. I’ve heard that the war
has hit you—it’s hit all the big landowners; but you’re—good
heavens! you’re not poor. Think of the servants you keep,
and the motor-cars——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, that’s my hopeless parents, who won’t give up anything
they’ve been accustomed to, and who say that it’s not
worth while making ourselves uncomfortable in small things
when only something colossal can save us. If we moved into
the Lodge tomorrow and lived on five hundred a year it would
still take us more than a lifetime to scrape up enough to free
the land.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then what do you propose to do?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, don’t you see, if I live at home I can manage somehow
to keep down expenses, so that the interest on the mortgages
gets paid—and when Greening’s gone and I’m agent I
can do a lot to improve the estate, and send the value up so
that we can sell some of the outlying farms over by Stonelink
and Guestling—that’ll bring in ready money, and then
perhaps I’ll be able to pay off some of the mortgages.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But couldn’t you do all that if you married me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, because for one thing I shouldn’t be allowed to try.
Father wouldn’t have me for agent.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Stella darling, don’t make it so difficult for me. It’s
so hard for me to tell you&#160;... can’t you see that my people
want to get money above all things—lots of it? If I marry
you it’ll be the end of all their hopes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They want you to marry money.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They want us all to marry money. Oh, don’t think I’m
going to do it—I couldn’t marry anyone I didn’t love. But
I feel I’ve got my duty to them as well as to you&#160;...
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and it’s not only to them&#160;... oh, Stella sweetheart, don’t
cry!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I—I can’t help it. Oh, Peter, it all sounds so—so dreadful,
so sordid—and so—so cruel, to you as well as to me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He longed to take her in his arms, but dared not, partly for
fear of his own weakness, partly for fear she would repulse
him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Darling—I’m not explaining well; it’s so difficult. And I
know it’s sordid, but not so sordid as you think. It’s simply
that I feel I must stand by my family now—and I don’t mean
just my people, you know; I mean all the Alards&#160;...
all that ever were. I can’t let the place be sold up, as it will
have to be if I don’t save it. Think of it&#160;... and the first
part to be sold would have to be Starvecrow, because it’s the
only free, unmortgaged land we’ve got. Oh, Stella, think of
selling Starvycrow!”</p>

<p class='c015'>She took away her hands and looked at him through her
streaming tears.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, don’t look at me like that—don’t reproach me. What
I’m doing is only half selfish—the other half is unselfish, it’s
sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Peter, what does it matter if the land is sold? What
good is the land doing you?—what good will it ever do you,
if it comes to that? Why should we suffer for the land?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I thought you’d have understood that better.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t understand at all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not that I must stand by my people?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t understand why your people can’t be happy without
owning all the land in three parishes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, my dear....”</p>

<p class='c015'>He tried to take her hand, but this time she pulled it away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s no good, Peter. I understand your selfish reason better
than your unselfish one. I fail to see why you should sacrifice
me and yourself to your family and their land. I can
see much better how you can’t bear the thought of losing
Starvecrow. I know how you love it, because I love it too-but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>much as I love it, I never could sacrifice you to it, my
dear, nor any human soul.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know—I know. I’m a beast, Stella—but it’s like this&#160;... human beings change—even you may change—but
places are always the same.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I love you now—but how do I know&#160;... Mary
married for love.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What’s Mary got to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’s shown me that one can never be sure, even with
love.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mean to say you’re not sure if you’d be happy with
me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Darling, I’m as sure as I can ever be with any human being.
But one never can be quite sure, that’s the terrible thing.
And oh, it would be so ghastly if you changed—or I changed—and
I had left the unchanging place for you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella rose quietly to her feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I understand now, Peter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>For a moment she stood motionless and silent, her mouth
set, her eyes shining out beyond him. He wondered if she
was praying.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella—don’t hate me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t hate you—I love you. But I quite understand that
you don’t love me. Your last words have shown me that.
And your not loving me explains it all. If you really loved
me all these difficulties, all these ambitions would be like—like
chaff. But you don’t love me, at least not much; and I
don’t want you, if you only love me a little. I’m relieved
in a way—I think you’d be doing a dreadful thing if you
gave me up while you really loved me. But you don’t really
love me, so you’re quite right to give me up and stand by your
family and Starvecrow. Oh, I know you love me enough to
have married me if everything had been easy....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella, don’t—It isn’t that I don’t love you; it’s only that
I can’t feel sure of the future with you—I mean, there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>so many things about you I can’t understand—your way
of looking at life and things....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I know, my dear—don’t trouble to explain to me. And
don’t think I’m angry, Peter—only sick—sick—sick. I don’t
want to argue with you any more—it’s over. And I’ll make
things as easy for you as I can, and for myself too. I’ll go
away—I’ll have to. I couldn’t bear meeting you after this—or
seeing Starvecrow....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She went to the door, and he hoped she would go straight
out, but on the threshold she suddenly turned——</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not angry, Peter—I’m not angry. I was, but I’m not
now&#160;... I’m only miserable. But I’ll be all right&#160;...
if I go away. And some day we’ll be friends again....”</p>

<p class='c015'>The door crashed behind her. She was gone.</p>

<p class='c015'>I hope you won’t think it awful cheek of me to write to
you, but I’ve been thinking of doing so for a long time—ever
since you left, in fact. I felt so very sorry that just
after I’d begun to know you again you should go away. You
see I’m rather odd-man-out in the family, for though Jenny
and I have always been pals, she’s frightfully preoccupied
with things just now, and I get back so late and start off
again so early next morning that I see very little of people
at home. The same fact makes it difficult for me to keep up
with the people I knew at school—I can’t have them at Conster,
anyway. And at the works—oh, Gee! I can’t think
where they come from. Either they’re of quite a bit different
class, which I can get on with, though I don’t think I could
ever make a friend of it, or else they’re a type of man I’ve
never struck before, the kind that’s always talking of horses
and girls, and the way he talks it’s rather difficult to tell
’tother from which. So may I—now it’s coming out!—may I
write to you now and then? It would make such a difference
to me, and you needn’t answer—at least, not so often as I
write. I’d never dare ask you this to your face, but I can
write things I can’t say. So please let me—it would be such
a relief, and I’d be so grateful. I don’t pretend for a minute
that it’ll be entertaining for you—I’ll simply be getting things
off my chest. You see, I do such a frightful lot of thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>on the way to and from Ashford and you’ve done a lot of
thinking too—I’m sure of it—so perhaps you’ll understand my
thoughts, though I can tell you some of ’em are precious
silly. This letter is a pretty fair specimen of what you’d
have to expect, so if you don’t like it, squash me at once, for
I’d hate to be a nuisance to you.</p>

<p class='c015'>I hope you’re still liking the clinic. Your father told us
about it last Sunday. I expect he’s given you all the Leasan
and Vinehall news. He’ll have told you about Dolly Hurst’s
wedding, anyhow. It was a simply terrible affair. I had to
go, because they heartlessly chose a Saturday afternoon, and
I was nearly stifled with the show. The church reeked of
flowers and money and Israelites. In spite of my decided
views on the filthiness of lucre, I can’t help thinking it a waste
that a rich Gentile should marry a rich Jew when there are
plenty of poor Gentiles in the neighbourhood. However, the
bridegroom looks a decent fellow, and not so violently a son
of Abraham. He had three sisters who were bridesmaids,
and all treats, as we say at the shop. Forgive these vulgar
musings on a solemn subject, but the occasion provokes them—and
anyhow write and tell me if I may write again.</p>

<p class='c015'>Very many thanks for your letter. Of course go on writing—I
shall love hearing from you, though please don’t think
I’m clever and “do a lot of thinking”—because I don’t. And
I’m glad you say you won’t be exacting in the way of
answers for I’m frightfully busy here. I have to be at the
clinic at nine every morning, and often don’t get away till
after six. I do all the dispensary work, weigh babies, etc.—it’s
all most amusing, and I love it, and would be ever so
happy if I felt Father was getting on all right without me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Now you might help me here and tell me what you think of
Miss Gregory. Father of course makes out that he’s perfectly
satisfied, but I feel that may be only because he doesn’t
want me to worry or think I ought to come back. So you
tell me if you think she’s a dud, though of course I don’t
expect you’ll have much opportunity for finding out.</p>

<p class='c015'>Yes, Father told me about the Hurst wedding, and I had a
letter too from Mrs. George Alard. It seems to have been a
regular Durbar. I’m rather surprised they found it possible
to get married in church, the bridegroom not being a Christian.
But perhaps he’s Jewish only by race. I hope so, because
Mrs. George said Peter seemed very much smitten with his
sister, who was chief bridesmaid. Of course this may be
only her imagination. I wonder if you noticed anything. I
suppose Peter’s living at Starvecrow now. I hope so much
he’ll be able to do all he wanted for the estate.</p>

<p class='c015'>Excuse more, but I’m frightfully busy this week, as there
are one or two cases of smallpox in the city and a lot of
vaccination being done.</p>

<p class='c015'>When we were together in the summer you told me you
had quite “got over” Peter Alard, and I was so glad. All
the same I want to send you the enclosed newspaper cutting
before you have a chance of hearing the news from any
other source—I feel it might still be a shock. I wish I had
been less of a dull fellow and had my suspicions beforehand—then
I might have prepared you—but I assure you I never
thought of it. He met her for the first time at her brother’s
wedding to Miss Hurst in May—she was one of the bridesmaids—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>I’m told now that she stayed at Conster for a
fortnight while we were away in August. She was down
again this last week and I met her once or twice—she seems a
very nice girl, quiet and well-bred and decidedly above the
average in brains, I should think. Lady Alard told me she
is writing a book. I was asked up to dinner last night, and
Sir John announced the engagement, and this morning it was
in the <cite>Times</cite>, so I’m writing off to you at once. My darling,
you know how sorry I am that things did not turn out as we
had both so fondly hoped. But I think that what has happened
may be a comfort to you in many ways, as you were
so afraid he would marry Dolly Hurst to please his family
and we both agreed she could never make him happy. Miss
Asher seems much more likely to be the kind of wife he
wants—she is not so cold and intellectual, but seems warm-hearted
and friendly, though as I’ve told you she’s decidedly
clever. Peter seemed extremely happy when I congratulated
him—it’s so nice to think that I can tell you this, and that
your love was always of a kind which wanted his happiness
more than its own. But I’m afraid this will be a blow to
you, dear; in spite of what you have told me, and I heard
Mass this morning with a special intention for you. I will
write again in a day or two and tell you how the Elphicks
are getting on and the rest of the news, but I must stop now
as I hear Miss Gregory trying to crank up the car. It’s
funny how she never seems able to manage it when the
engine’s cold, while a little bit of a thing like you never failed
to get it started. Goodbye, my darling, and God bless you.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Thank you so much for writing to me the way you did, because
in spite of what I said at Grasmere I think it would have
been rather a shock if I’d seen it in the paper. Of course
I have “got over” Peter in a way, but, oh, dear, it always
gives one rather a pang to see one’s old love marrying—you
remember all the lovely things he said to <em>you</em>, and you
wonder if he’s now saying just the same to the other girl.
I’m afraid this sounds rather cynical and sad, and a bit selfish,
because I had definitely broken off with Peter, and since he
can’t have really and truly loved me I ought to be glad he’s
found someone he can really and truly love. Oh, I do hope
he really and truly loves her, but one’s always afraid in a case
like this when there’s money. It may have influenced him
unconsciously, though I’m quite sure he wouldn’t have married
her if he hadn’t been fond of her as well. Still “fond
of” isn’t enough—oh, it would be dreadful to think he’d
given me up and then married another woman whom he
didn’t love even as much as he loved me. But do believe me,
Father dear, I’m being sensible. Yesterday I went to confession
and this morning I went to the Altar, and I feel ever
so much better than I did at first. Of course, after what I
said it seems ridiculous to mind so much, but it’s only when
a thing is utterly finished that one realises how one has been
stupidly hoping against hope the whole time.</p>

<p class='c018'>I had a letter from Gervase yesterday, telling me a lot about
Vera Lorna Isabel. I think she sounds nice, though rather
brainy for old Peter. She and Dolly Hurst were both in a
sort of literary set up in London and have met lots of authors
and authoresses. Gervase says she has read them some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>her book, and it’s frightfully clever, but he doesn’t think she’ll
finish it now she’s engaged. I still hear regularly from Gervase;
he writes once a week and I write once a fortnight,
which sounds unfair, but you know how busy I am—though,
for the matter of that, so is he. I think he’s an awfully nice
boy, and I admire him for breaking free from the family tradition
and striking out a line of his own.</p>

<p class='c018'>Really Miss Gregory’s an awful ass if she can’t crank up
the car—I never knew a car start easier, even on a cold morning.
Father, when Peter’s safely married I think I’ll come
home. I can’t bear being away from you, and I know nobody
looks after you as well as I do (said she modestly). It’ll
be quite all right—I came away partly for Peter’s sake as
well as my own—I thought it would help the thing to die
easier—but really I’d be a hopeless fool if I could never bear
to meet him again, and whatever would become of you without
me? How good of you to hear Mass for me. How is
Father Luce? Please give him my love, though I don’t suppose
he wants it. Does he talk any more now? I wish he’d
be a more entertaining companion for you on Sunday evenings.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lots of love and kisses and thanks and bless-yous from</p>

</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ 1</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>February was nearly over when Peter came back from his
Algerian honeymoon, and found Starvecrow waiting to receive
him. It was the mild end of a rainy day, with the air full
of yellow sunshine, which was reflected in the floods of the
Tillingham marshes. The house was faintly bloomed with
it, and its windows shone like golden pools. Peter caught
his first glimpse from the top of Brede Eye hill, and his
heart grew warm in the chill English dusk as no African sun
had made it. “Look!” he said to Vera, and pointed over
the top of Conster’s firs at the grey and golden house with
its smoking chimneys—for the first time the smoke of his own
fires was going up from Starvecrow.</p>

<p class='c015'>The car—the splendid Sunbeam which Vera’s parents had
given as their wedding-present—swept down into the valley,
over the Tillingham bridge, and up Starvecrow’s twisting
drive, reflecting the rushing hazels and apple-trees in the mirror
of its polished sides. Without noise or jar it stopped outside
the porch—“Wait for the man, dear,” said Vera, but Peter
was out, staring enraptured at his own front door. He had
a foolish, ridiculous feeling that he wanted to carry her across
the threshold, but was deterred by the appearance of a smart
parlourmaid, also by Vera’s obvious unpreparedness for so
primitive an entrance.</p>

<p class='c015'>So he contented himself with kissing her in the delightful
drawing-room that led out of the hall. A large wood fire
burned in the open fireplace, and bright cretonnes were in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>rather sophisticated contrast to oak beams and pure white
walls. The house had been thoroughly overhauled, and amazing
treasures had come to light in the way of Tudor fireplaces
and old oak. It seemed to Peter that it was now more like a
small country house than the farmhouse of his love and
memory, but certainly these things were more appropriate than
the Greenings’ rather ramshackle furniture, Victorian wallpapers
and blackleaded grates.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Isn’t it lovely?” breathed Vera, crouching down by the fire
and warming her delicate hands.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, it is,” said Peter—“and so are you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He put his hand on her little close-fitting hat and tilted
back her head till her full, rather oriental lips were under his.
He loved her long, satisfying kisses, so unlike the uneasy ones
of most English girls—he told himself that it was this Eastern
quality in her love, inherited through the Jewish blood of her
fathers, which had made the last few weeks so wonderful.</p>

<p class='c015'>A minute later the parlourmaid brought in tea, and they
had it together beside the singing hearth. There was no
light in the room except the dancing glow on beams and walls,
the reflections from polished silver and lustre-ware. Vera
did not talk much, for she was tired, and after tea she said
she would like to go up to her room and lie down before
dinner. Peter offered to go with her and read her to sleep—he
could not bear to be away from her very long—but Vera
said she would rather be quiet, in which no doubt she was
wise, for the gods had not given Peter the gift of reading
aloud.</p>

<p class='c015'>Well, perhaps it was all to the good that she did not want
him, because he would have to go up to Conster some time
this evening, and he would rather go now than after dinner,
when he could be sitting on the hearthrug at Vera’s feet keeping
their first watch together by their own fire. So though
he was feeling a bit fagged himself after the journey, he put
on his overcoat again and went out into the early darkness
which was thick with a new drizzle.</p>

<p class='c015'>Starvecrow was lost in the night, except for a golden square
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>which was Vera’s room, and the distant sulky glow of a lantern
among the barns. Only a gleaming of puddles and the
water in the ruts showed him the farm drive—which had remained
a farm-drive in spite of the Asher’s wish that it should
become an avenue; for, as he pointed out to them, his traffic
of wagons would do for nothing more genteel. As he reached
the bottom, the distant murmur of a car, far away in the network
of lanes between Starvecrow and Vinehall, made him
unaccountably think of Stella. Queer&#160;... it must be just a
year since he had seen her last. How many things had happened
since then, and how seldom he thought of her now—poor
little girl!... And yet he had loved her—there was
no good making out that he hadn’t—and he had been grief-stricken
when she had gone away—thought a dozen times of
calling her back and letting Starvecrow and the rest go
hang.... It merely showed that Mary was right, and love,
like everything else, could die. Would his love for Vera die?—why
not, since his love for Stella had died?—But his love
for Vera was so warm and alive—So had his love for Stella
been once. Oh, damn! he was getting into a melancholy mood—it
must be the effect of the journey. Thank God! here he
was at Conster and wouldn’t have much more time for the
blues, though the thought of seeing his family again did not
give him any overwhelming pleasure.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 2</h3>

<p class='c014'>He found his father and mother and two sisters in the
drawing-room, and it seemed to him that their greeting had
a queer, uneasy quality about it, a kind of abstraction—as if
their thoughts were centred on something more engrossing than
his return. When he had gone his round of kisses and handshakes,
Lady Alard seemed suddenly to express the real
interest of the party by crying in a heartbroken voice——</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter! what <em>do</em> you think has happened?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What?” cried Peter sharply. He had a vision of a foreclosing
mortgagee.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“It’s Mary!” wailed Lady Alard—“Julian is divorcing her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mary!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter was genuinely shocked—the Alards did not appear in
the divorce court; also his imagination was staggered at
the thought of Mary, the fastidious, the pure, the intense,
being caught in the coarse machinery of the state marriage
laws.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—isn’t it utterly dreadful? It appears he’s had her
watched by detectives ever since she left him, and now they’ve
found something against her—at least they think they have.
It was that time she went abroad with Meg Sellons, and
Charles joined them at Bordighera—which I always said was
unwise. But the worst of all, Peter, is that she says she won’t
defend herself—she says that she’s done nothing wrong, but
she won’t defend herself—she’ll let Julian put her away, and
everyone will think she’s—oh, Peter, this will finish me—it
really will. When I got Mary’s letter I had the worst attack
I’ve had for years—we had to send for Dr. Mount in
the middle of the night. I really thought——”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir John interrupted her——</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’d better let me finish, Lucy. The subject is legal, not
medical. Mary has behaved like a fool and run her head into
Julian’s trap. I don’t know how much there is in it, but from
what she says I doubt if he has much of a case. If she’ll
defend it, she’ll probably be able to clear herself, and what’s
more I bet she could bring a counter-petition.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That would be a nasty mess, wouldn’t it, Sir?” said Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not such a nasty mess as my daughter being held up in
all the newspapers as an adulteress!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, John!” cried Lady Alard—“what a dreadful thing to
say before the girls!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Doris is old enough to hear the word now if she’s never
heard it before, and Jenny—she’s Emancipated, and a great
deal older than you and me. I tell you I object to my daughter
being placarded in the penny papers as an adulteress, and I’d
much rather she proved Julian an adulterer.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is that possible, sir?” asked Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Of course it is—the man’s been on the loose for a year.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If that’s all your evidence——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I haven’t had him followed by detectives, but I
can turn a few on now, and——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Really, Sir, I do agree with Mary that it would be better
to leave the matter alone. An undefended case can be slipped
through the papers with very little fuss, while if you have
a defence, to say nothing of a cross-petition&#160;... it isn’t as
if she particularly wanted to keep Julian as a husband—I
expect she’s glad to have the chance of getting rid of him
so easily.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I daresay she is. I daresay she wants to marry that old
ass Charles Smith. But what about her reputation?—what
about ours? I tell you I’m not going to stand still and have
filth thrown at me by the press. I’m proud of my name if
you aren’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It really seems to me that the matter rests with Mary—if
she doesn’t want to defend herself....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mary must think of her family—it ought to come before
her private feelings.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The words seemed an echo of a far-back argument—they
reminded Peter dimly of his own straits last year. The family
must come first.... That time it was money, now it was
reputation. After all, why not? There was no good holding
to the one and letting the other go. But he was sorry for
Mary all the same.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I can’t stay any longer now. I must be getting back
to dinner. I’ll bring Vera up tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mary’s coming down in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, is she?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—I’ve wired for her. I insist on her listening to reason.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So Mary would have to face Peter’s choice—family duty
against personal inclination.... Well, after all he hadn’t
made such a bad thing of it.... He thought of Vera waiting
for him at Starvecrow, and in spite of the fret of the last
half-hour a smile of childlike satisfaction was on his face as
he went home.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ 3</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Peter was out early the next morning, when the first pale
sunshine was stealing up the valley of the Tillingham, flooding
all the world in a gleam of watery gold. He had awoken to
the music of his farm, to the crowing of his cocks, to the
stamping of his cattle in their stalls, to the clattering of his
workmen’s feet on the cobbles of the yard. Starvecrow was
his home, his place for waking up and falling asleep, for eating
his food and warming himself at his fire, for finding his
wife at the end of the day, for the birth of his children....
He had, as he stood that morning in the yard, a feeling both
of proud ownership and proud adoption.</p>

<p class='c015'>The whole farm, house and buildings, looked tidy and
prosperous. It had lost that rather dilapidated, if homely, air
it had worn before his marriage. Though the Ashers might
have neither enough capital nor inclination to pay off the
debts of their son-in-law’s family, they had certainly been
generous in the matter of their daughter’s home. But for
them the place could never have been what it was now—trimmings
and clippings, furnishings and restorings had been their
willingly paid price for Alard blood. The whole farm had
been repaired, replanted and restocked. Indeed Starvecrow
was now not so much a farm as a little manor, a rival to Conster
up on the hill. Was this exactly what Peter had intended
for it?—he did not stop to probe. No doubt his imagination
had never held anything so solid and so trim, but that
might have been only because his imagination had planned
strictly for the possible, and all that had been possible up to
his falling in love with Vera was just the shelter of that big
kindly roof, the simplicity of those common farmhouse
rooms, with the hope and labour of slow achievement and slow
restoration.</p>

<p class='c015'>Still, he was proud of the place, and looked round him
with satisfaction as he walked down the bricked garden path,
beside the well-raked herbaceous border. He went into the
yard where his men were at work—he now employed two extra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>hands, and his staff consisted of a stockman, a shepherd, a
ploughman, and two odd men, as well as the shepherd’s wife,
who looked after the chickens and calves.</p>

<p class='c015'>Going into the cowhouse he found Jim Lambard milking
the last of the long string of Sussex cows. He greeted his
master with a grin and a “good marnun, sur”—it was good to
hear the slurry Sussex speech again. Peter walked to the
end of the shed where two straw-coloured Jerseys were
tethered—one of them, Flora, was due to calve shortly, and
after inspecting her, he went out to interview the stockman.
John Elias had held office not only in Greening’s time, but
in the days before him when Starvecrow was worked by a
tenant farmer—he was an oldish man who combined deep
experience and real practical knowledge with certain old-fashioned
obstinacies. Peter sometimes found him irritating
to an intense degree, but clung to him, knowing that the
old obstinacies are better than the new where farm-work is
concerned, and that the man who insists on doing his work
according to the rules of 1770 is really of more practical
value than the man who does it according to the rules of the
Agricultural Labourers’ Union. Elias had now been up a
couple of nights with the Jersey, and his keen blue eye was
a trifle dim from anxiety and want of sleep. Peter told him
to get off to bed for a few hours, promising to have him sent
for if anything should happen.</p>

<p class='c015'>He then sent for the ploughman, and discussed with him
the advisability of giving the Hammer field a second ploughing.
There was also the wheat to be dressed in the threshing
machine before it was delivered to the firm of corn-merchants
who had bought last year’s harvest. A final talk with
his shepherd about the ewes and prospects for next month’s
lambing—and Peter turned back towards the house, sharp-set
for breakfast and comfortably proud of the day’s beginning.
He liked to think of the machinery of his farm, working efficiently
under his direction, making Starvecrow rich.... Conster
might still shake on its foundations but Starvecrow was
settled and established—he had saved Starvecrow.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>The breakfast-room faced east, and the sunshine poured
through its long, low window, falling upon the white cloth
of the breakfast table, the silver, the china and the flowers.
The room was decorated in yellow, which increased the effect
of lightness—Peter was thrilled and dazzled, and for a moment
did not notice that breakfast had been laid only for one.
When he did, it gave him a faint shock.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where’s your mistress?” he asked the parlourmaid, who
was bringing in the coffee—“isn’t she coming down?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, sir. She’s taking her breakfast upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter felt blank. Then suddenly he realised—of course
she was tired! What a brute he was not to think of it—it
was all very well for him to feel vigorous after such a journey,
and go traipsing round the farm; but Vera—she was made of
more delicate stuff.... He had a feeling as if he must
apologise to her for having even thought she was coming
down; and running upstairs he knocked at her door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come in,” said Vera’s rather deep, sweet voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her room was full of sunshine too, but the blind was down
so that it did not fall on the bed. She lay in the shadow,
reading her letters and smoking a cigarette. Peter had another
shock of the incongruous.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My darling, are you dreadfully tired?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—I feel quite revived this morning,” and she lifted
her long white throat for him to kiss.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you had your breakfast?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All I want. I’m not much of a breakfast eater, that’s one
reason why I prefer having it up here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But—but aren’t you ever coming down?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Poor boy—do you feel lonely without me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, damnably,” said Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, my dear, I’d be poor company for you at this hour.
I’m much better upstairs till ten or eleven—besides it makes
the day so long if one’s down for breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter looked at her silently—her argument dispirited him:
“the day so long.”... For him the day was never long enough.
He suddenly saw her as infinitely older and tireder than himself.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Run down and have yours, now,” she said to him, “and
then you can come up and sit with me for a bit before I
dress.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 4</h3>

<p class='c014'>The next day Mary Pembroke came to Conster, and that
same evening was confronted by her family. Sir John insisted
on everyone being present, except Gervase—whom he
still considered a mere boy—and the daughters-in-law. Vera
was glad to be left out, for she had no wish to sit in judgment
on a fellow woman, in whose guilt she believed and
with whose lies she sympathised, but Rose was indignant, for
she detected a slight in the omission.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Besides,” she said to her husband, “I’m the only one who
considers the problem chiefly from a moral point of view—the
rest think only of the family, whether it will be good or
bad for their reputation if she fights the case.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What about me?” asked her husband, perhaps justly aggrieved—“surely
you can trust me not to forget the moral
side of things.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I hope so I’m sure. But you must speak out and
not be afraid of your father.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not afraid of him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Indeed you are—you never can stand up to him. It’s he
who manages this parish, not you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How can you say that?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What else can I say when you still let him read the lessons
after he created such a scandal by saying ‘damn’ when
the pages stuck together.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nobody heard him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Indeed they did—all the three first rows, and the choir
boys. It’s so bad for them. If I’d been in your place he
shouldn’t have read another word.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear, I assure you it wasn’t such a scandal as you
think—certainly not enough to justify a breach with my
father.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s just it—you’re afraid of him, and I want you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>stand your ground this time. It’s not right that we should
be looked down upon the way we are, but we always will be
if you won’t stick up for yourself—and I really fail to see
why you should countenance immorality just to please your
father.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Perhaps it was owing to this conversation with his wife that
during most of the conference George sat dumb. As a matter
of fact, nobody talked much, except Sir John and Mary.
Mary had a queer, desperate volubility about her—she who
was so aloof had now become familiar, to defend her aloofness.
Her whole nature shrank from the exposure of the
divorce court.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But what have you got to expose?” cried Sir John when
she used this expression, “you tell me you’ve done nothing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve loved Julian, and he’s killed my love for him—I don’t
want that shown up before everybody.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It won’t be—it doesn’t concern the case.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, yes, it does—that sort of thing always comes out—‘the
parties were married in 1912 and lived happily together
till 1919, when the respondent left the petitioner without any
explanation’—it’ll be all to Julian’s interest to show that he
made me an excellent husband and that I loved him devotedly
till Something—which means Somebody—came between us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’ll do that if you don’t defend the case.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But it won’t be dwelt on—pored over—it won’t provide
copy for the newspapers. Oh, can’t anybody see that when a
woman makes a mistake like mine she doesn’t want it read
about at the breakfast tables of thousands of—of——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“One would understand you much better,” said Doris, who
for a few moments had been swallowing violently as a preliminary
to speech—“one would understand you much better
if what you objected to was thousands of people reading that
you’d been unfaithful to the husband you once loved so much.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But it wouldn’t be true.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’d believe it all the same—naturally, if the decree was
given against you.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“I don’t care about that—it’s what’s true that I mind people
knowing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t be a fool,” interrupted Sir John—“you’re not going
to disgrace your family for an idea like that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll disgrace it worse if I give the thing all the extra publicity
of a defended suit.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Mary dear,” said Lady Alard—“think how dreadful
it will be for us as well as for you if the decree is given against
you. There’s Jenny, now—it’s sure to interfere with her
prospects—What did you say, Jenny?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nothing, Mother,” said Jenny, who had laughed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you don’t seem to consider,” persisted Mary, “that
even if I defend the case I may lose it—and then we’ll all
be ever so much worse off than if I’d let it go quietly through.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And Julian have his revenge without even the trouble of
fighting for it!” cried Sir John. “I tell you he’s got nothing
of a case against you if you choose to defend it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not so sure of that. Appearances are pretty bad.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Egad, you’re cool, Ma’am!—But I forgot—you don’t care
tuppence what people think as long as they don’t think what’s
true. But, damn it all, there’s your family to be considered
as well as yourself.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is it that you want to marry Charles Smith?” asked Peter.
“If she does, Sir, it’s hardly fair to make her risk....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Listen to me!” George had spoken at last—the voice of
morality and religion was lifted from the chesterfield. “You
must realise that if the decree is given against her, she will
not be free in the eyes of the Church to marry again. Whereas
if she gets a decree against her husband, she would find certain
of the more moderate-minded clergy willing to perform
the ceremony for the innocent partner.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t see that,” said Peter rudely—“she’d be just as innocent
if she lost the suit.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She wouldn’t be legally the innocent partner,” said George,
“and no clergyman in the land would perform the ceremony
for her.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“Which means that the Church takes the argument from
law and not from facts.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—no. Not at all. In fact, the Church as a whole condemns,
indeed—er—forbids the re-marriage of divorced persons.
But the Church of England is noted for toleration, and
there are certain clergy who would willingly perform the
ceremony for the innocent partner. There are others—men
like Luce, for instance—who are horrified at the idea of such
a thing. But I’ve always prided myself on——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hold your tongue, George,” broke in his father, “I won’t
have you and Peter arguing about such rubbish.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not arguing with him, Sir. I would scarcely argue
with Peter on an ecclesiastical subject. In the eyes of the
Church——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Damn the eyes of the Church! Mary is perfectly free to
re-marry if she likes, innocent or guilty. If the Church won’t
marry her, she can go to the registrar’s. You think nothing
can be done without a clergyman, but I tell you any wretched
little civil servant can do your job.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You all talk as if I wanted to marry again—” Mary’s
voice shot up with a certain shrill despair in it. “I tell you
it’s the last thing in the world I’d ever do—whatever you
make me do I would never do that. Once is enough.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It would certainly look better if Mary didn’t re-marry,”
said Doris, “then perhaps people would think she’d never
cared for Commander Smith, and there was nothing in it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But why did you go about with him, dear?” asked Lady
Alard—“if you weren’t really fond of him?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I never said I wasn’t fond of him. I am fond of him—that’s
one reason why I don’t want to marry him. He’s been
a good friend to me—and I was alone&#160;... and I thought I
was free.... I saw other women going about with men, and
nobody criticising. I didn’t know Julian was having me
watched. I didn’t know I wasn’t free—and that now, thanks
to you, I’ll never be free.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She began to cry—not quietly and tragically, as one would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>have expected of her—but loudly, noisily, brokenly. She
was broken.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c014'>The next morning Sir John drove up to London to consult
his solicitors. The next day he was there again, taking Mary
with him. After that came endless arguments, letters and
consultations. The solicitors’ advice was to persuade Julian
Pembroke to withdraw his petition, but this proved impossible,
for Julian, it now appeared, was anxious to marry again. He
had fallen in love with a young girl of nineteen, whose parents
were willing to accept him if Mary could be decorously got
rid of.</p>

<p class='c015'>This made Sir John all the more resolute that Mary should
not be decorously got rid of—if mud was slung there was
always a chance of some of it sticking to Julian and spoiling
his appearance for the sweet young thing who had won the
doubtful prize of his affections. He would have sacrificed
a great deal to bring a counter-petition, but very slight investigations
proved that there was no ground for this. Julian
knew what he was doing, and had been discreet, whereas Mary
had put herself in the wrong all through. Sir John would
have to content himself with vindicating his daughter’s
name and making it impossible for Julian to marry his new
choice.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary’s resistance had entirely broken down—the family
had crushed her, and she was merely limp and listless in their
hands. Nothing seemed to matter—her chance of a quiet
retreat into freedom and obscurity was over, and now seemed
scarcely worth fighting for. What did it matter if her life’s
humiliation was exposed and gaped at?—if she had to stand
up and answer dirty questions to prove her cleanness?...
She ought to have been stronger, she knew—but it was difficult
to be strong when one stood alone, without weapon or
counsellor.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny and Gervase were on her side, it is true, but they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>were negligible allies, whether from the point of view of impressing
the family, or of any confidence their advice and
arguments could inspire in herself. Vera Alard, though she
did not share the family point of view, had been alienated by
her sister-in-law’s surrender—“I’ve no sympathy with a
woman who knows what she wants but hasn’t the courage to
stand out for it,” she said to Peter. In her heart she thought
that Mary was lying—that she had tried Charles Smith as a
lover and found him wanting, but would have gladly used him
as a means to freedom, if her family hadn’t butted in and
made a scandal of it.</p>

<p class='c015'>As for Peter, he no longer felt inclined to take his sister’s
part. He was angry with her for her forgetfulness of her
dignity. She had been careless of her honour, forgetting that
it was not only hers but Alard’s—she had risked the family’s
disgrace, before the world and before the man whose contempt
of all the world’s would be hardest to bear. Peter hated
such carelessness and such risks—he would do nothing more
for Mary, especially as she had said she did not want to marry
Charles Smith. If she had wanted that he would have understood
her better, but she had said she did not want it, and
thus had lost her only claim to an undefended suit. For Peter
now did not doubt any more than his family that Julian would
fail to prove his case.</p>

<p class='c015'>Outside the family, Charles Smith did his best to help her.
He came down to see her and try to persuade her people to
let the petition go through undefended. But he was too like
herself to be much use. He was as powerless as she to stand
against her family, which was entering the divorce court in
much the same spirit as its forefathers had gone to the Crusades—fired
by the glory of the name of Alard and hatred
of the Turk.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m disappointed in my first co-respondent,” said Gervase
to Jenny after he had left—“I’d expected something much
more spirited—a blend of Abelard, Don Juan and Cesare
Borgia, with a dash of Shelley. Instead of which I find a
mild-mannered man with a pince-nez, who I know is simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>dying to take me apart and start a conversation on eighteenth-century
glass.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s because he isn’t a real co-respondent. You’ve only
to look at Charles Smith to be perfectly sure he never did
anything wrong in his life.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, let’s hope the Judge and jury will look at him, then.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hope they won’t. I’m sure Mary wants to lose.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not a defended case—she’d be simply too messed up after
that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’ll be messed up anyhow, whether she wins or loses.
There’ll be columns and columns about her and everything
she did—and didn’t do—and might have done. Poor Mary&#160;... I expect she’d rather lose, and then she can creep quietly
away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you think she’ll marry Smith?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I don’t. He’d like to marry her, or he thinks he’d
like to, but I’m pretty sure she won’t have him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then she’d better win her case—or the family will make
her have him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“George says she can’t marry again unless she’s the ‘innocent
party.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t think what George says will make much difference.
Anyhow, it’s a silly idea. If the marriage is dissolved, both
of ’em can marry again—if the marriage isn’t dissolved,
neither of ’em can, so I don’t see where George’s innocent
party comes in. That’s Stella’s idea—part of her religion,
you know—that marriage is a sacrament and can’t be dissolved.
I think it’s much more logical.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think it’s damned hard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, so do I. But then I think religion ought to be damned
hard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll remind you of that next time I see you lounging in
front of the fire when you ought to be in church. You know
you hurt George’s feelings by not going.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not partial to George’s sort of religion.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hope you’re not partial to Stella’s—that would be another
blow for this poor family.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“Why?—it wouldn’t make any difference to them. Not that
you need ever be afraid of my getting religion&#160;... but if I
did I must say I hope it would be a good stiff sort, that would
give me the devil of a time. George arranges a nice comfortable
service for me at eleven, with a family pew for me
to sleep in. He preaches a nice comfortable sermon that makes
me feel good, and then we all go home together in the nice
comfortable car and eat roast beef and talk about who was
there and how much there was in the collection. That isn’t
my idea of the violent taking the Kingdom of Heaven by
storm.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you trying to make me think that you’d be pious if
only you were allowed to wear sandals and a hair shirt?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, no, Jenny dear. But at least I can admire that sort
of religion from a distance.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The distance being, I suppose, from here to Birmingham?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“May I ask if you are what is vulgarly called getting at
me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’d like to know how long this correspondence between
you and Stella has been going on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Almost ever since she left—but we’ve only just got on to
religion.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Be careful—that’s all. I don’t want you to hurt yourself.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How?—with Stella or with Stella’s ideas?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Both,” said Jenny darkly.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 6</h3>

<p class='c014'>Charles Smith was not allowed to come down again. The
solicitors declared it advisable that Mary should see nothing
of him while proceedings were pending. Indeed it was necessary
to guard her reputation like a shrine. She stayed at
Conster while the weeks dragged through the spring, and when
in May Sir John and Lady Alard went for their yearly visit
to Bath, it was decided that she should go to the Vicarage,
so that a polish of sanctity and ecclesiastical patronage might
be given to her stainlessness.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>So she packed her belongings—helped by Jenny instead of
Gisèle, whose wages had been beyond her means ever since
her plunge for freedom—and they were taken to where Leasan
Parsonage stood hidden among May trees and lilac bushes down
Leasan lane.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary was not personally looking forward to the change,
though the atmosphere of Conster was eruptive, and though
one felt the family solidarity more strongly at the Manor
than at the Parsonage, and was also—in spite of luxury—more
conscious of the family’s evil days. Her feeling for Rose
was almost fear—her bustle, her curiosity, her love of rule,
her touch of commonness provoked an antipathy which was
less dislike than alarm. She also shrank from the ugliness and
discomforts of the Vicarage life—Rose was supposed to have
a gift for training Raw Girls, and, as Gervase once said even
when the girls ceased to be actually raw, they were still remarkably
underdone. Chatter, scoldings, creaking footsteps,
and the smell of bad cooking filled the house all day—George,
whom Mary was inclined to like in spite of his stupidity,
took the usual male refuge in flight, and spent most of his
time shut up in his study, which shared the sanctity of Leasan
church and could be invaded by no one but his wife.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were also two rather colourless children, Lillian and
Edna, whose governess—a more cultured type of Raw Girl—made
a sixth at luncheon. It had always been a secret grief
to Rose that she had never had a son; her only comfort was
that no other Alard had done so up till now. But this comfort
would probably be taken from her soon. Vera would
be sure to have a son—Jewesses always did.... Rose thought
vaguely about Abraham....</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 7</h3>

<p class='c014'>The day started early at Leasan Parsonage—not that there
was any particular reason why it should, but eight o’clock
breakfast was Rose’s best protest against the sloppy ways of
Conster, where you came down to breakfast when you liked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>or had it upstairs. Mary was addicted to the latter vice, and
on her first morning at Leasan came down heavy-eyed, with
that especial sense of irritation and inadequacy which springs
from a hurried toilet and a lukewarm bath.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So you wear a tea-gown for breakfast,” said Rose, who
wore a sports coat and a tweed skirt.</p>

<p class='c015'>“A breakfast gown.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s the same thing. In fact you might call it a dressing-gown
with those sleeves. Edna, don’t drink your tea with a
spoon.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s too hot, Mother.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, leave it till it gets cooler. Don’t drink it with a
spoon—you’ll be pouring it into your saucer next. George,
what are your letters about today?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Income tax mostly—and there’s Mr. Green writing again
about a Choral Celebration.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, you must be firm with him and tell him we can’t
possibly have one. I told you what it would be, engaging an
organist who’s used to such things—they won’t give them up.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I thought it might be possible to arrange it once a month,
at an hour when it won’t interfere with Matins.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nonsense, dear. The boys’ voices could never manage it
and the men would go on strike.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’re becoming fairly general, you know, even in country
churches.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I think it’s a pity. I’ve always distrusted anything
that tends to make religion emotional.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t understand anyone’s emotions—at least voluptuous
emotions—being stirred by anything our choir could do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“George!—‘voluptuous’”—a violent shake of the head—“pas
devant les enfants. Who’s your cheque from?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dr. Mount. He’s very generously subscribing to the Maternity
Fund. He says ‘I feel I’ve got a duty to Leasan
as well as Vinehall, as I have patients in both parishes.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I call that very good of him, for I know he never makes
more than five hundred a year out of the practice. By the
way, have you heard that Stella’s back?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“No—since when?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I saw her driving through Vinehall yesterday. Edna and
Lillian, you may get down now for a great treat, and have
a run in the garden before Miss Cutfield comes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“May we go to meet Miss Cutfield?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you don’t go further than the end of the lane. That’s
right, darlings—say your grace—‘for what we <em>have</em> received,’
Edna, not ‘about to’—now run away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why are you sending away the children?” asked George.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Because I want to talk about Stella Mount.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But why is Stella unfit to discuss before the children?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, George—you must know!—it was simply dreadful the
way she ran after Peter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You don’t think she’s still running after him?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think it’s a bad sign she’s come back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Her father wanted her, I expect. That chauffeur-secretary
he had was no good. Besides, I expect she’s got over her
feeling for Peter now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sure I hope she has, but you never know with a girl
like Stella. She has too many ways of getting out of things.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What do you mean, dear?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, confession and all that. All she has to do is to go
to a Priest and he’ll let her off anything.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come, come, my dear, that is hardly a fair summary of
what the Prayer Book calls ‘the benefit of absolution.’ My
own position with regard to confession has always been that
it is at least tolerable and occasionally helpful.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not the way a girl like Stella would confess,” said Rose
darkly—“Oh, I don’t mean anything wrong—only the whole
thing seems to me not quite healthy. I dislike the sort of
religion that gets into everything, even people’s meals. I
expect Stella would rather die than eat meat on Friday.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But surely, dear,” said George who was rather dense—“that
sort would not encourage her to run after a married
man.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, if you can’t use your eyes!&#160;... she’s been perfectly
open about it.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“But she hasn’t been here at all since he married.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m talking of before that—when she was always meeting
him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But if he wasn’t married you can hardly accuse her of
running after a married man.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s married now. Don’t be so stupid, dear.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 8</h3>

<p class='c014'>Peter was a little annoyed to find that Stella had come back.
It would perhaps be difficult to say why—whether her return
was most disturbing to his memory or to his pride. He
would have angrily denied that to see her again was in any
sense a resurrection—and he would just as angrily have denied
that her attitude of detached friendliness was disagreeable to
his vanity. Surely he had forgotten her&#160;... surely he did
not want to think that she could ever forget him....</p>

<p class='c015'>He did not press these questions closely—his nature shrank
from unpleasant probings, and after all Stella’s presence did
not make anything of that kind necessary. He saw very little
of her. She came to tea at Starvecrow, seemed delighted with
the improvements, was becomingly sweet to Vera—and after
that all he had of her was an occasional glimpse at Conster
or on the road.</p>

<p class='c015'>It could not be said, by any stretch of evidence, that she
was running after a married man. But Rose Alard soon had
a fresh cause for alarm. Stella was seeing a great deal too
much of Gervase. She must somehow have got into touch with
the younger brother during her absence from home, for now
on her return there seemed to be a friendship already established.
They were occasionally seen out walking together in
the long summer evenings, and on Sundays he sometimes
went with her to church at Vinehall—which was a double
crime, since it disparaged George’s ministrations at Leasan.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I should hate to say she was mercenary,” said Rose reflectively,
“but I must say appearances are against her—turning
to the younger brother as soon as she’s lost the elder.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“I don’t see where the mercenariness comes it,” said Mary—“Gervase
won’t have a penny except what he earns, and there’s
Peter and his probable sons, as well as George, between him
and the title.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But he’s an Alard—I expect Stella would like to marry
into the family.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I fail to see the temptation.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, anyhow, I think it very bad taste of her to take him
to church at Vinehall—it’s always been difficult to get him to
come here as it is, and George says he has no influence over
him whatever.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary only sighed. She could not argue with Rose, yet
she had a special sympathy for a woman who having had love
torn out of her heart tried to fill the empty aching space as
best she could. Of course it was selfish—though not so selfish
in Stella as it had been in herself, and she hoped Stella
would not have to suffer as she had suffered. After all, it
would do Gervase good to be licked into shape by a woman
like Stella—he probably enjoyed the hopelessness of his love—if
indeed it was hopeless&#160;... and she could understand
the relief that his ardent, slightly erratic courtship must be
after Peter’s long series of stolid blunders.</p>

<p class='c015'>But Stella was not quite in the position Mary fancied. She
was not letting Gervase court her, indeed he would never
have thought of doing so. She seemed definitely apart from
any idea of love-making—she set up intangible barriers round
herself, which even his imagination could not cross. Perhaps
some day&#160;...  but even for “some day” his plans were not
so much of love as of thinking of love.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile she fulfilled a definite need of his, just as he
fulfilled a need of hers. She gave him an outlet for the pent-up
thoughts of his daily drives, and the society of a mind which
delighted him with its warmth and quickness. Gervase too
had a quick mind, and his and Stella’s struck sparks off each
other, creating a glow in which he sometimes forgot that
his heart went unwarmed. Their correspondence had been a
slower, less stimulating version of the same process. They had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>discussed endless subjects through the post, and now Stella
had come home in the midst of the most interesting. It was
the most interesting to him because it was obviously the most
interesting to her. She had bravely taken her share in their
other discussions, but he soon discovered that she was too
feminine to care about politics, too concrete to grasp abstractions,
and that in matters of art and literature her taste was
uncertain and often philistine. But in the matter of religion
she showed both a firmer standing and a wider grasp. Indeed
he was to find that her religion was the deepest, the most
vital and most interesting part of her—in it alone did the
whole Stella come alive.</p>

<p class='c015'>The topic had been started by the tragedy of Mary’s marriage,
and at first he had been repulsed by her attitude, which
he thought strangely unlike her in its rigidity. But as time
went on he began to contrast it favourably with George’s compromises—here
was a faith which at least was logical, and
which was not afraid to demand the uttermost.... They
continued the discussion after she had come home, and he
was surprised to see what he had hitherto looked upon equally
as a fad and a convention, a collection of moral and intellectual
lumber, show itself almost shockingly as an adventure and a
power. Not that Stella had felt the full force of it yet—her
life had always run pretty smoothly through the simplicities
of joy and sorrow, there had been no conflict, no devastation.
But strangely enough he, an outsider, seemed able to see what
she herself possibly did not realise—that she carried in her
heart a force which might one day both make and break it.</p>

<p class='c015'>It had been his own suggestion that he should go with her
to church, though he did not know whether it was to satisfy
a hope or dismiss a fear. He had lost the detached attitude
with which he had at first approached the subject, much as he
would have approached Wells’s new novel or the Coalition
Government. To his surprise he found himself at ease in the
surroundings of Vinehall’s Parish Mass. Its gaiety and homeliness
seemed the natural expression of instinctive needs.
Vinehall church was decorated in a style more suggestive of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>combined poverty and enterprise than of artistic taste; the
singing—accompanied rather frivolously on a piano—was poor
and sometimes painful; the sermon was halting and trite.
These things were better done by brother George at Leasan.
But the Mass seemed strangely independent of its outward
expression, and to hold its own solemn heart of worship under
circumstances which would have destroyed the devotions of
Leasan. Here, thought Gervase, was a faith which did not depend
on the beauty of externals for its appeal—a faith, moreover,
which was not afraid to make itself hard to men, which
threw up round itself massive barriers of hardship, and yet
within these was warm and sweet and friendly—which was
furthermore a complete adventure, a taking of infinite risks,
a gateway on unknown dangers....</p>

<p class='c015'>As he knelt beside Stella in a silence which was like a first
kiss, so old in experience did it seem, in spite of the shock
of novelty, he found that the half-forgotten romances of his
childhood were beginning to take back their colours and shine
in a new light. Those figures of the Mother and her Child,
the suffering Son of Man, the warm-hearted, thick-headed,
glorious company of the apostles, which for so long had lived
for him only in the gilt frames of Renaissance pictures, now
seemed to wake again to life and friendliness. Once more he
felt the thrill of the Good Shepherd going out to see the lost
sheep&#160;... and all the bells of heaven began to ring.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 9</h3>

<p class='c014'>George Alard could not help being a little vexed at Gervase’s
new tendencies. He told himself that he ought to be
glad the boy was going to church at all, for he had been
negligent and erratic for a long time past—he ought not to
feel injured because another man had won him to some sense
of his duty. But he must say he was surprised that Luce
had succeeded where he himself had failed—Luce was a dry,
dull fellow, and hopelessly unenterprising; not a branch in his
parish of the C.E.M.S. or the A.C.S. or the S.P.G., no work-parties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>or parish teas, and no excitement about the Enabling
Act and the setting up of a Parochial Church Council which
was now occupying most of George’s time. Still, he reflected,
it was probably not so much Luce as Stella Mount who had
done it—she was a pretty girl and perhaps not too scrupulous,
she had persuaded Gervase. Then there had always been
that curious streak in his brother’s character which differentiated
him from the other Alards. George did not know how
to describe it so well as by Ungentlemanliness. That part of
Gervase which had revolted from a Gentleman’s Education
and had gone into an engineering shop instead of to Oxford
was now revolting from a Gentleman’s Religion and going
to Mass instead of Dearly Beloved Brethren. There had always
seemed to George something ungentlemanly about Catholicism,
though he prided himself on being broad-minded,
and would have introduced one or two changes on High
Church lines into the services at Leasan if his father and his
wife had let him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Apart from every other consideration, I’m surprised he
doesn’t realise how bad it looks for him to go Sunday to
Vinehall when his brother is Vicar of Leasan.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He goes with Stella,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think that makes it worse,” said Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?” asked Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>He had come in to see George about his election to the
Parochial Church Council, which his brother was extremely
anxious should take place, but for which Peter had no wish
to qualify himself. George had hoped that the bait of a
seat on the Council, with the likelihood of being elected as
the Parish’s representative at the Diocesan Conference, might
induce Peter to avail himself once more of the church privileges
which he had neglected for so long. It was uphill work,
thought poor George, trying to run a parish when neither of
one’s brothers came to church, and one’s father said ‘damn’
out loud when reading the lessons....</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?” asked Peter, a little resentful.</p>

<p class='c015'>Rose looked uneasy——</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Well, everyone knows she used to run after you and now
she’s running after Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She didn’t run after me and she isn’t running after Gervase,”
said Peter; then he added heavily—“I ran after her,
and Gervase is running after her now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh!” Rose tossed her head—“I own I once thought&#160;...
but then when you married Vera&#160;... well, anyhow I think
she ought to discourage Gervase more than she does, and I
insist that it’s in extremely bad taste for her to take him to
church at Vinehall.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perhaps he likes the service better,” said Mary, who during
this discussion had been trying to write a letter and now
gave up the effort in despair.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I daresay he does—he’s young and excitable.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s nothing very exciting at Vinehall,” said George—“I
don’t think Luce has even a surpliced choir these days.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, there’s incense and chasubles and all that—Gervase
always did like things that are different.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I must say,” said Mary, who was perhaps a little irritated
at having nowhere to write her letter (the Raw Girl
being in devastating possession of her bedroom)—“I must
say that if I had any religion myself, I’d like a religion which
at least was religion and not soup.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Both George and Rose sat up stiffly, and even Peter looked
shocked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, your religion here seems chiefly to consist in giving
people soup-tickets and coal-tickets, and having rummage
sales. Stella Mount’s religion at least means an attempt at
worship, and at least.... Oh, well—” she broke down rather
lamely—“anyhow it makes you want something you haven’t
got.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We can most of us do that without religion,” said Peter,
getting up.</p>

<p class='c015'>Rose looked meaningly after him as he went out of the
room, then she looked still more meaningly at her husband—it
was as if her eyes and eyebrows were trying to tell him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>her conviction that Peter was finding life unsatisfactory in
spite of Vera and Starvecrow, indeed that he regretted Stella—had
he not championed her almost grotesquely just now?&#160;... and
he had talked of wanting something he had not
got....</p>

<p class='c015'>George refused to meet her eyes and read their language.
He too rose and went out, but he did not follow Peter. He
felt hurt and affronted by what Mary had said—“soup”&#160;... that
was what she had called the religion of her parish church,
of her country, indeed, since George was convinced that Leasan
represented the best in Anglicanism. Just because he didn’t
have vestments and incense and foreign devotions, but plain,
hearty, British services—because he looked after people’s
bodies as well as their souls—he was to be laughed at by a
woman like Mary, who—but he must not be uncharitable, he
was quite convinced of Mary’s innocence, and only wished
that her prudence had equalled it.</p>

<p class='c015'>He walked out through the French windows of his study,
and across the well-kept Vicarage lawn. Before him, beyond
the lilacs Leasan’s squat towers stood against a misty blue
sky. With its wide brown roof spreading low over its aisles
almost to the ground the church was curiously like a sitting
hen. It squatted like a hen over her brood, and gave a tender
impression of watchfulness and warmth.... The door stood
open, showing a green light that filtered in through creeper
and stained glass. George went in, and the impression of
motherly warmth was changed to one of cool emptiness.
Rows of shining pews stretched from the west door to the
chancel with its shining choir-stalls, and beyond in the sanctuary
stood the shining altar with two shining brass candlesticks
upon it.</p>

<p class='c015'>George went to his desk and knelt down. But there was
something curiously unprayerful in the atmosphere—he would
have felt more at ease praying in his study or at his bedside.
The emptiness of the church was something more than an
emptiness of people—it was an emptiness of prayer. Now he
came to think of it, he had never seen anyone at prayer in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the church except at the set services—a good collection of the
neighbouring gentlefolk at Matins, a hearty assembly of the
villagers at Evensong, a few “good” people at the early celebration,
and one or two old ladies for the Litany on Fridays—but
never any prayer between, no farm lad ever on his
knees before his village shrine, or busy mother coming in for
a few minutes’ rest in the presence of God....</p>

<p class='c015'>But that was what they did at Vinehall. He had looked
into the church several times and had never seen it empty—there
was always someone at prayer&#160;... the single white
lamp&#160;... that was the Reserved Sacrament of course, theologically
indefensible, though no doubt devotionally inspiring&#160;... devotion—was it that which made the difference between
religion and soup?</p>

<p class='c015'>George felt a sudden qualm come over him as he knelt in
his stall—it was physical rather than mental, though the
memory of Mary’s impious word had once again stirred up
his sleeping wrath. He lifted himself into a sitting position—that
was better. For some weeks past he had been feeling
ill—he ought to see a doctor&#160;... but he daren’t, in case the
doctor ordered him to rest. It was all very well for Mary
to gibe at his work and call it soup, but it was work that
must be done. She probably had no idea how hard he worked—visiting,
teaching, sitting on committees, organising guilds,
working parties, boy scouts, Church of England Men’s Society&#160;... and two sermons on Sunday as well.... He was sure
he did more than Luce, who had once told him that he looked
upon his daily Mass as the chief work of his parish.... Luce
wouldn’t wear himself out in his prime as George Alard was
doing.... Soup!</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 10</h3>

<p class='c014'>Mary went back to Conster for the uneasy days of the
Summer. Her heart sickened at the dragging law—her marriage
took much longer to unmake that it had taken to make.
She thought of how her marriage was made—Leasan church&#160;... the smell of lilies&#160;... the smell of old lace&#160;... lace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>hanging over her eyes, a white veil over the wedding-guests,
over her father as he gave her away, over her brother as he
towered above her in surplice and stole, over her bridegroom,
kneeling at her side, holding her hand as he parted her shaking
fingers&#160;... “with this ring I thee wed”&#160;... “from this
day forward, till death do us part.”... How her heart was
beating—fluttering in her throat like a dove&#160;... now she
was holding one fringed end of George’s stole, while Julian
held the other—“that which God hath joined together let not
man put asunder.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And now the unmaking—such a fuss—such a business this
putting asunder! Telegrams, letters, interviews&#160;... over and
over again the story of her disillusion, of her running away,
of her folly&#160;... oh, it was all abominable, but it was her
own fault—she should not have given in. Why could she
never endure things quite to the end? When she had found
out that Julian the husband was not the same as Julian the
lover, but an altogether more difficult being, why had her
love failed and died? And now that love was dead and she
had run away from the corpse, why had she allowed her
family to persuade her into this undignified battle over the
grave? Why had she not gone quietly out of her husband’s
life into the desolate freedom of her own, while he turned
to another woman and parted her fingers to wear the pledge
of his eternal love.</p>

<p class='c015'>If only she had been a little better or a little worse!...
A little better, and she could have steadied her marriage when
it rocked, a little worse and she could have stepped out of it
all, cast her memories from her, and started the whole damn
thing over again as she had seen so many women do. But
she wasn’t quite good enough for the one or bad enough for
the other, so she must suffer as neither the good nor the bad
have to suffer. She must pay the price for being fine, but
not fine enough.</p>

<p class='c015'>In Autumn the price was paid. For three days counsel
argued on the possibility or impossibility of a woman leaving
one man except for another—on the possibility or impossibility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of a woman being chaste when in the constant society of a
male friend—on the minimum time which must be allowed
for misconduct to take place. Waiters, chambermaids, chauffeurs
gave confused evidence—there was “laughter in court”—the
learned judge asked questions that brought shame into
the soft, secret places of Mary’s heart—Julian stood before
her to tell her and all the world that she had loved him
once.... She found herself in the witness-box, receiving
from her counsel the wounds of a friend.... Of course
Julian must be blackened to account for her leaving him—was
she able to paint him black enough? Probably not, since
the verdict was given in his favour.</p>

<p class='c015'>Most of the next day’s papers contained photographs of
Mrs. Pembroke leaving the divorce court after a decree nisi
had been obtained against her by her husband, Mr. Julian
Pembroke (inset).</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 11</h3>

<p class='c014'>In spite of the non-committal attitude of his solicitors, Sir
John Alard had been sure that to defend the suit would be
to vindicate Mary and her family against the outrageous
Julian. He would not believe that judgment could go against
his daughter except by default, and now that this incredible
thing had happened, and Mary had been publicly and argumentatively
stripped of her own and Alard’s good name, while
Julian, with innocence and virtue proclaimed by law, was
set free to marry his new choice, he felt uncertain whether to
blame most his daughter’s counsel or his daughter herself.</p>

<p class='c015'>Counsel had failed to make what he might out of Julian’s
cross-examination&#160;... what a fruitful field was there! If
only Sir John could have cross-examined Julian himself!
There would have been an end of that mirage of the Deceived
and Deserted Husband which had so impressed the court....
But Mary was to blame as well as counsel. She really had
been appallingly indiscreet&#160;... her cross-examination—Lord!
what an affair! What a damn fool she had made of herself!—Hang
it all, he’d really have thought better of her if she’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>gone the whole hog&#160;... the fellow wasn’t much good in
the witness-box either&#160;... but he’d behaved like a gentleman
afterwards. He had made Mary a formal proposal of
marriage the morning after the decree was given. The only
thing to do now was for her to marry him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Lady Alard marked her daughter’s disgrace by sending for
Dr. Mount in the middle of the night, and “nearly dying on
his hands” as she reproachfully told Mary when she returned
to Conster the next afternoon. Mary looked a great deal more
ill than her mother—dazed and blank she sat by Lady Alard’s
sofa, listening to the tale of her sorrows and symptoms, only
a slow occasional trembling of her lip showing that her heart
was alive and in torment under the dead weight of her body’s
stupefaction. All her mind and being was withdrawn into
herself, and during the afternoon was in retreat, seeking
strength for the last desperate stand that she must make.</p>

<p class='c015'>After tea, Peter arrived, looking awkward and unhappy—then
George, looking scared and pompous. Mary knew that
a family conclave had been summoned, and her heart sank.
What a farce and a sham these parliaments were, seeing that
Alard was ruled by the absolute monarchy of Sir John. No
one would take her part, unless perhaps it was Gervase—Uranus
in the Alard system—but he would not be there today;
she must stand alone. She gripped her hands together
under the little bag on her lap, and in her dry heart there was
a prayer at last—“Oh, God, I have never been able to be quite
true to myself—now don’t let me be quite untrue.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As soon as the servants had cleared away the last of the
tea things—there had been a pretence of offering tea to
Peter and George, as if they had casually dropped in—Sir
John cast aside all convention of accident, and opened the
attack.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” he said to his assembled family—“it’s been a dreadful
business—unexpectedly dreadful. Shows what the Divorce
Court is under all this talk about justice. There’s been only
one saving clause to the whole business, and that’s Smith’s
behaviour. He might have done better in the witness-box,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>but he’s stuck by Mary all through, and made her a formal
offer of marriage directly the decree was given.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That was the least he could do,” said Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course; you needn’t tell me that. But I’ve seen such
shocking examples of bad faith during the last three days....
It’s a comfort to find one man behaving decently. I’m
convinced that the only thing Mary can do is to marry him
as soon as the decree is made absolute.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George gave a choking sound, and his father’s eye turned
fiercely upon him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, sir—what have <em>you</em> to say?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I—I—er—only that Mary can’t marry again now—er—under
these new circumstances&#160;... only the innocent partner....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You dare, Sir! Damn it all—I’ll believe in my own daughter’s
innocence in spite of all the courts in the country.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t mean that she isn’t innocent—er—in fact—but the
decree has been given against her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What difference does that make?—if she was innocent before
the decree she’s innocent after it, no matter which way
it goes. Damn you and your humbug, Sir. But it doesn’t
matter in the least—she can marry again, whatever you say;
the law allows it, so you can’t stop it. She shall be married
in Leasan church.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She shall not, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A deep bluish flush was on George’s cheek-bones as he rose
to his feet. Sir John was for a moment taken aback by defiance
from such an unexpected quarter, but he soon recovered
himself.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I tell you she shall. Leasan belongs to me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The living is in your gift, Sir, but at present I hold it, and
as priest of this parish, I refuse to lend my church for the
marriage of the guil—er—in fact, for—the marriage.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Bunkum! ‘Priest of this parish’—you’ll be calling yourself
Pope next. If you can’t talk sense you can clear out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George was already at the door, and the hand he laid upon
it trembled violently.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“Don’t go!”—it was Mary who cried after him—“there’s
no need for you to upset yourself about my marriage. I
haven’t the slightest thought of getting married.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But George had gone out.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 12</h3>

<p class='c014'>There was an uneasy shuffle of relief throughout the room.
The situation, though still painful, had been cleared of an exasperating
side-issue. But at the same time Mary was uncomfortably
aware that she had changed the focus of her
father’s anger from her brother to herself.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What do you mean?” he rapped out, when the sound of
George’s protesting retreat had died away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I mean that you and George have been arguing for nothing.
As I told you some time ago, I haven’t the slightest
intention of marrying Charles.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And why not, may I ask?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Because I’ve had enough of marriage.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But Mary, think of us—think of your family,” wailed
Lady Alard—“what are we going to do if you don’t marry?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t see what difference it will make.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It will make all the difference in the world. If you marry
Charles and go abroad for a bit, you’ll find that after a time
people will receive you—I don’t say here, but in London.
If you don’t marry, you will always be looked upon with
suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Married women without husbands always are.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then in spite of all the judges and juries and courts and
decrees, I’m still a married woman?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t see what else you’re to call yourself, dear. You’re
certainly not a spinster, and you can’t say you’re a widow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then if I marry again I shall have two husbands, and
in six months Julian will have two wives.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Lady Alard began to weep.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“For God’s sake! let’s stop talking this nonsense,” cried
Sir John. “Mary’s marriage has been dissolved, and her one
chance of reinstating herself—and us—is by marrying this
man who’s been the cause of all the trouble. I say it’s her
duty—she’s brought us all into disgrace, so I don’t think it’s
asking too much of her to take the only possible way of getting
us out, even at the sacrifice of her personal inclinations.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Father—I never asked you to defend the case. I begged
you not to—all this horror we have been through is due to
your defence.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you’d behaved properly there would have been no case
at all, and if you had behaved with only ordinary discretion
the defence could have been proved. When I decided that we
must, for the honour of the family, defend the case, I had no
idea what an utter fool you had been. Your cross-examination
was a revelation to me as well as to the court. You’ve
simply played Old Harry with your reputation, and now the
only decent thing for you to do is to marry this man and get
out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can get out without marrying this man.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And where will you go?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I shall go abroad. I have enough money of my own to
live on quietly, and I needn’t be a disgrace to anyone. If I
marry Charles I shall only bring unhappiness to both of us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Mary, do be reasonable!” cried Lady Alard—“do
think of the girls”—with a wave that included both twenty-two
and thirty-eight—“and do think how all this is your own
fault. When you first left Julian, you should have come here
and lived at home, then no one would ever have imagined
anything. But you would go off and live by yourself, and
think you could do just the same as if you weren’t married—though
I’m sure I’d be sorry to see Jenny going about with
anyone as you went about with Charles Smith. When I was
engaged to your father, we were hardly ever so much as left
alone in a room together——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your reminiscences are interesting, my dear,” said Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>John, “but cast no light on the situation. The point is that
Mary refuses to pay the price of her folly, even though by
doing so she could buy out her family as well as herself.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I fail to see how.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then you must be blind.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It seems to me it would be much better if I went right
away. I’ve made a hideous mess of my life, and brought
trouble upon you all—I acknowledge that; but at least there’s
one thing I will not do—and that is walk with my eyes open
into the trap I walked into ten years ago with my eyes shut.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then you need expect nothing more from your family.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I won’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Father,” said Peter—“if she isn’t fond of the chap....”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary interrupted him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t—it isn’t quite that. I am fond of him. I’m not in
love with him or anything romantic, but I’m fond of him, and
for that very reason I won’t take this way out. He’s twenty
years older than I am, and set in his bachelor ways—and I
firmly believe that only chivalry has made him stand by me as
he has done. He doesn’t in his heart want to marry a woman
who’s ruined and spoiled&#160;... and I won’t let him throw himself
away. If I leave him alone, he can live things down—men
always can; but if I marry him, he’ll sink with me. And
I’ve nothing to give him that will make up to him for what
he will suffer. I won’t let him pay such a price for&#160;... for
being&#160;... kind to me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Nobody spoke a word. Perhaps the introduction of Charles
Smith’s future as a motive for refusing to use him to patch
up the situation struck the Alards as slightly indecent. And
Mary suddenly knew that if the argument were resumed she
would yield—that she was at the end of her resources and
could stand out no longer. Her only chance of saving Charles’s
happiness and her own soul now lay in the humiliation of
flight. There is only one salvation for the weak and that is
to realise their weakness. She rose unsteadily to her feet.
A dozen miles seemed to yawn between her and the door....</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“Where are you going, Mary?” asked Sir John—“we haven’t
nearly finished talking yet.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Would anybody help her?—yes—here was Jenny unexpectedly
opening the door for her and pushing her out. And
in the hall was Gervase, his Ford lorry throbbing outside in
the drive.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase!” cried Mary faintly—“if I pack in ten minutes,
will you take me to the station?”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 13</h3>

<p class='c014'>It was a very different packing from that before Mary’s
departure eighteen months ago. There was no soft-treading
Gisèle, and her clothes, though she had been at Leasan six
months, were fewer than when she had come for a Christmas
visit. They were still beautiful, however, and Mary still
loved them—it hurt her to see Jenny tumbling and squeezing
them into the trunk. But she must not be critical, it was as
well perhaps that she had someone to pack for her who did
not really care for clothes and did not waste time in smoothing
and folding&#160;... because she must get out of the house
quickly, before the rest of the family had time to find out
what she was about. It was undignified, she knew, but her
many defeats had brought her a bitter carelessness.</p>

<p class='c015'>The sisters did not talk much during the packing. But
Mary knew that Jenny approved of what she was doing. Perhaps
Jenny herself would like to be starting out on a flight
from Alard. She wondered a little how Jenny’s own affair
was going—that unacknowledged yet obsessing affair. She
realised rather sadly that she had lost her sister’s confidence—or
perhaps had never quite had it. Her own detachment, her
own passion for aloofness and independence had grown up
like a mist between them. And now when her aloofness was
destroyed, when some million citizens of England were acquainted
with her heart, when all the golden web she had spun
round herself was torn, soiled and scattered, her sister was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>gone. She stood alone—no longer set apart, no longer veiled
from her fellows by delicate self-spun webs—but just alone.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Shall I ring for Pollock?” said Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I’d much rather you didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then how shall we manage about your trunk?—it’s too
heavy for us to carry down ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Can’t Gervase carry it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—I expect he could.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She called her brother up from the hall, and he easily swung
up the trunk on his shoulder. As he did so, and Mary saw
his hands with their broken nails and the grime of the shop
worked into the skin, she realised that they symbolised a freedom
which was more actual than any she had made. Gervase
was the only one of the family who was really free, though
he worked ten hours a day for ten shillings a week. Doris
was not free, for she had accepted the position of idle daughter,
and was bound by all the ropes of a convention which
had no substance in fact. Peter was not free because he had,
Mary knew, married away from his real choice, and was now
bound to justify his new choice to his heart—George was not
free, he was least free of all, because individual members of
the family had power over him as well as the collective fetish.
Jenny was not free, because she must love according to opportunity.
Slaves&#160;... all the Alards were slaves&#160;... to Alard—to
the convention of the old county family with its prosperity
of income and acres, its house, its servants, its ancient
name and reputation—a convention the foundations of which
were rotten right through, which was bound to topple sooner
or later, crushing all those who tried to shelter under it. So
far only two had broken away, herself and Gervase—herself
so feebly, so painfully, in such haste and humiliation, he so
calmly and carelessly and sufficiently. He would be happy and
prosperous in his freedom, but she&#160;... she dared not think.</p>

<p class='c015'>However, Jenny was thinking for her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What will you do, Mary?” she asked, as they crossed the
hall—“where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“I’m going back to London. I don’t know yet what I’ll
do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you enough money? I can easily lend you something—I
cashed a cheque yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I’m quite all right, thanks.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you think you’ll go abroad?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll try to. Meg is going again next month. I expect I
could go with her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They were outside. Mary’s box was on the back of the
lorry, and Gervase already on the driver’s seat. It was rather
a lowly way of leaving the house of one’s fathers. Mary had
never been on the lorry before, and had some difficulty in
climbing over the wheel.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny steadied her, and for a moment kept her hand after
she was seated.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course you know I think you’re doing the only possible
thing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes&#160;... thank you, Jenny; but I wish I’d done it earlier.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How could you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Refused to defend the case—spared myself and everybody
all this muck.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s very difficult, standing up to the family. But you’ve
done it now. I wish I could.... Goodbye, Mary dear, and
I expect we’ll meet in town before very long.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Goodbye.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Ford gargled, and they ran round the flower-bed in
the middle of Conster’s gravel sweep. Jenny waved farewell
from the doorstep and went indoors. Gervase began to
whistle; he seemed happy—“I wonder,” thought Mary, “if
it’s true that he’s in love.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 14</h3>

<p class='c014'>During the upheaval which followed Mary’s departure,
George Alard kept away from Conster. He wouldn’t go any
more, he said, where he wasn’t wanted. What was the good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of asking his advice if he was to be insulted—publicly insulted
when he gave it? He brooded tenaciously over the scene
between him and his father. Sir John had insulted him not
only as a man but as a priest, and he had a right to be offended.</p>

<p class='c015'>Rose supported him at first—she was glad to find that there
were occasions on which he would stand up to his father.
George had been abominably treated, she told Doris—really
one was nearly driven to say that Sir John had no sense of
decency.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He speaks to him exactly as if he were a child.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He speaks to us all like that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then it’s high time somebody stood up to him, and I’m
very glad George did so.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear Rose—if you think George stood up....”</p>

<p class='c015'>After a time Rose grew a little weary of her husband’s
attitude, also though she was always willing to take up arms
against the family at Conster, she had too practical an idea of
her own and her children’s interests to remain in a state of
war. George had made his protest—let him now be content.</p>

<p class='c015'>But George was nursing his injury with inconceivable perseverance.
Hitherto she had often had to reproach him for
his subservience to his father, for the meekness with which
he accepted his direction and swallowed his affronts.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you can put up with his swearing in church, you can
put up with what he said to you about Mary.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He has insulted me as a priest.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He probably doesn’t realise you are one.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s just it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She seemed to have given him fresh cause for brooding.
He sulked and grieved, and lost interest in his parish organisations—his
Sunday School and Mothers’ Union, his Sewing
Club and Coal Club, his Parochial Church Council—now established
in all its glory, though without Peter’s name upon the
roll, his branches of the S.P.G., the C.E.M.S., all those activities
which used to fill his days, which had thrilled him
with such pride when he enumerated them in his advertisements
for a locum in the <cite>Guardian</cite>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>He developed disquieting eccentricities, such as going into
the church to pray. Rose would not have minded this if he
had not fretted and upset himself because he never found
anyone else praying there.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why should they?” she asked, a little exasperated—“They
can say their prayers just as well at home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve never been into Vinehall church and found it empty.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, you’re still worrying about Gervase going to Vinehall?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not talking about Gervase. I’m talking about people
in general. Vinehall church is used for prayer—mine is always
empty except on Sundays.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Indeed it’s not—I’ve often seen people in it, looking at the
old glass, and the carving in the South Aisle.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But they don’t pray.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course not. We English don’t do that sort of thing in
public. They may at Vinehall; but you know what I think of
Vinehall—it’s un-English.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I expect it’s what the whole of England was like before
the Reformation.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“George!” cried Rose—“you must be <em>ill</em>.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Only a physical cause could account for such mental disintegration.
She decided to send for Dr. Mount, who confirmed
her diagnosis rather disconcertingly. George’s heart
was diseased—had been diseased for some time. His case was
the exact contrast of Lady Alard’s—those qualms and stabs
and suffocations which for so long both he and his wife had
insisted were indigestion, were in reality symptoms of the
dread angina.</p>

<p class='c015'>He must be very careful not to overstrain himself in any
way. No, Dr. Mount did not think a parish like Leasan too
heavy a burden—but of course a complete rest and holiday
would do him good.</p>

<p class='c015'>This, however, George refused to take—his new obstinacy
persisted, and though the treatment prescribed by Dr. Mount
did much to improve his general condition, mental as well as
physical, he evidently still brooded over his grievances. There
were moments when he tried to emphasise his sacerdotal dignity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>by a new solemnity of manner which the family at Conster
found humorous, and the family at Leasan found irritating.
At other times he was extraordinarily severe, threatening such
discipline as the deprivation of blankets and petticoats to old
women who would not come to church—the most irreproachable
Innocent Partner could not have cajoled the marriage
service out of him then. He also started reading his office in
church every day, though Rose pointed out to him that it was
sheer waste of time, since nobody came to hear it.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 15</h3>

<p class='c014'>Social engagements of various kinds had always filled a good
deal of George Alard’s life—he and Rose received invitations
to most of the tea-parties, tennis-parties and garden-parties of
the neighbourhood. He had always considered it part of his
duty as a clergyman to attend these functions, just as he had
considered it his duty to sit on every committee formed within
ten miles and to introduce a branch of every episcopally-blessed
Society into his own parish. Now with the decline of his
interest in clubs and committees came a decline of his enthusiasm
for tennis and tea. Rose deplored it all equally——</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you won’t go to people’s parties you can’t expect them
to come to your church.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can and I do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But they won’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then let them stop away. The Church’s services aren’t a
social return for hospitality received.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“George, I wish you wouldn’t twist everything I say into
some ridiculous meaning which I never intended—and I do
think you might come with me to the Parishes this afternoon.
You know they’re a sort of connection—at least everyone hopes
Jim won’t marry Jenny.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t feel well enough,” said George, taking a coward’s
refuge—“not even to visit such close relations,” he added with
one of those stray gleams of humour which were lost on Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, this is the second time I’ve been out by myself this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>week, and I must say.... However, if you don’t feel well
enough.... But I think you’re making a great mistake—apart
from my feelings....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She went out, and George was left to the solitude and peace
of his study. It was a comfortable room, looking out across
the green, cedared lawn to the little church like a sitting hen.
The walls were lined with books, the armchairs were engulfing
wells of ease—there was a big writing-table by the window, and
a rich, softly-coloured carpet on the floor. Rose’s work-bag
on a side-table gave one rather agreeable feminine touch to
the otherwise masculine scene. The room was typical of hundreds
in the more prosperous parsonages of England, and
George had up till quite recently felt an extraordinarily calm
and soothing glow in its contemplation. It was ridiculous to
think that a few words from his father—his father who was
always speaking sharp, disparaging words—could have smashed
all his self-satisfaction, all his pride of himself as Vicar of
Leasan, all his comfortable possession of Leasan Vicarage and
Leasan Church.... But now he seemed to remember that the
dawn of that dissatisfaction had been in Leasan Church itself,
before his father had spoken—while he was kneeling there
alone among all those empty, shining pews....</p>

<p class='c015'>He would go out for a walk. If he stopped at home he
would only brood—it would be worse than going to the
Parishes. He would go over and see Dr. Mount—it would
save the doctor coming to the Vicarage, perhaps—there must
be a visit about due—and they could have a chat and some tea.
He liked Dr. Mount—a pleasant, happy, kind-hearted man.</p>

<p class='c015'>The day was good for walking. The last of Autumn lay in
ruddy veils over the woods of Leasan and Brede Eye. The
smell of hops and apples was not all gone from the lanes.
George walked through his parish with a professional eye on
the cottages he passed. Most of the doors were shut in the
afternoon stillness, but here and there a child swinging on a
gate would smile at him shyly as he waved a Vicarial hand,
or a woman would say “Good afternoon, Sir.” The cottages
nearly all looked dilapidated and in want of paint and repair.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>George had done his duty and encouraged thrift among his
parishioners, and the interiors of the cottages were many of
them furnished with some degree of comfort, but the exterior
structures were in bad condition owing to the poverty of the
Manor. He cleared his throat distressfully once or twice—had
one the right to own property when one could not afford
to keep it in repair?... His philanthropic soul, bred in the
corporal works of mercy, was in conflict with his racial instinct,
bred in the tradition of the Squires.</p>

<p class='c015'>When he came to Vinehall, he found to his disappointment
that Dr. Mount was out, and not expected to be home till late
that evening. George felt disheartened, for he had walked
three miles in very poor condition. He would have enjoyed a
cup of tea.... However, there was nothing to be done for it,
unless indeed he went and called on Luce. But the idea did
not appeal to him—he and the Rector of Vinehall were little
more than acquaintances, and Luce was a shy, dull fellow who
made conversation difficult. He had better start off home at
once—he would be home in time for a late tea.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then he remembered that the carrier’s cart would probably
soon be passing through Vinehall and Leasan on its way from
Robertsbridge station to Rye. If he went into the village he
might be able to pick it up at the Eight Bells. Unfortunately
he had walked the extra half-mile to the inn before he remembered
that the cart went only on Tuesdays, Thursdays
and Saturdays, and today was Wednesday. He would have
to walk home, more tired than ever. However, as he passed
through the village, he thought of the church, partly because
he was tired and wanted to rest, partly because Vinehall church
always had a perverse fascination for him—he never could pass
it without wanting to look in&#160;... perhaps he had a secret,
shameful hope that he would find it empty.</p>

<p class='c015'>He crossed the farmyard, wondering why Luce did not at
all costs provide a more decent approach, a wonder which was
increased when, on entering the church, he found he had admitted
not only himself but a large turkey, which in the chase
that followed managed somehow to achieve more dignity than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>his pursuer. After three laps round the font it finally disappeared
through the open door, and George collapsed on a
chair, breathing hard, and not in the least devout.</p>

<p class='c015'>The church had none of the swept, shiny look of Leasan,
nor had it Leasan’s perfume of scrubbing and brass-polish;
instead it smelt of stale incense, lamp-oil and old stones—partly
a good smell and partly an exceedingly bad one. It was seated
with rather dilapidated chairs, and at the east end was a huge
white altar like a Christmas cake. There were two more altars
at the end of the two side aisles and one of them was furnished
with what looked suspiciously like two pairs of kitchen candlesticks.
But what upset George most of all were the images,
of which, counting crucifixes, there must have been about a
dozen. His objections were not religious but aesthetic—it revolted
his artistic taste to see the Christ pointing to His Sacred
Heart, which He carried externally under His chin, to see St.
Anthony of Padua looking like a girl in a monk’s dress, to
see the Blessed Virgin with her rosary painted on her blue skirt—and
his sense of reverence and decency to see the grubby
daisy-chain with which some village child had adorned her.
Luce must have bought his church furniture wholesale at a
third-rate image shop....</p>

<p class='c015'>George wished he could have stopped here, but he was bound
to look further, towards the white star which hung in the east
Yes&#160;... it was just as usual&#160;... a young man in working
clothes was kneeling there&#160;... and an immensely stout old
woman in an apron was sitting not far off. Certainly the
spectacle need not have inspired great devotional envy, but
George knew that in his own parish the young man would
probably have been lounging against the wall opposite the
Four Oaks, while the old woman would have been having a
nap before her kitchen fire. Certainly neither would have been
found inside the church.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a murmur of voices at the back of the south aisle,
and looking round George saw one or two children squirming
in the pews, while behind a rather frivolous blue curtain showed
the top of a biretta. Luce was hearing confessions—the confessions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>of children.... George stiffened—he felt scandalised
at the idea of anyone under twelve having any religious needs
beyond instruction. This squandering of the sacraments on
the young&#160;... as if they were capable of understanding
them....</p>

<p class='c015'>He turned to go out, feeling that after all the scales had
dropped on the debit side of Vinehall’s godliness, when he
heard behind him a heavy tread and the flutter of a cassock.
Luce had come out of his confessional.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why—Mr. Alard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George was a little shocked to hear him speak out loud, and
not in the solemn whisper he considered appropriate for church.
The Rector seemed surprised to see him—did he want to speak
to him about anything?</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, no—I only looked in as I was passing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Seen our new picture?” asked Luce.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Which one?” The church must have contained at least a
dozen pictures besides the Stations of the Cross.</p>

<p class='c015'>“In the Sacrament Chapel.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They went down to the east end, where Luce genuflected,
and George, wavering between politeness and the Bishop of
Exeter’s definition of the Real Presence, made a sort of curtsey.
There was a very dark oil painting behind the Altar—doubtful
as to subject, but the only thing in the church, George told
himself, which had any pretence to artistic value.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mrs. Hurst gave us that,” said Luce—“it used to hang in
her dining-room, but considering the subject she thought it
better for it to be here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He had dropped his voice to a whisper—George thought it
must be out of respect to the Tabernacle, but the next minute
was enlightened.</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’s asleep,” he said, pointing to the stout old woman.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh,” said George.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Poor old soul,” said Luce—“I hope the chair won’t give
way—they sometimes do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He genuflected again, and this time the decision went in
favour of the Bishop of Exeter, and George bowed as to an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>empty throne. On their way out his stick caught in the daisy-chain
which the Mother of God was wearing, and pulled it off.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 16</h3>

<p class='c014'>He and Luce walked out of the church together and through
the farmyard without speaking a word. The silence oppressed
George and he made a remark about the weather.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, yes, I expect it will,” said Luce vaguely.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was a tall, white-faced, red-headed young man, who
spoke with a slight stutter, and altogether, in his seedy cassock
which the unkind sun showed less black than green, seemed to
George an uninspiring figure, whose power it was difficult to
account for. How was it that Luce could make his church a
house of prayer and George could not? How was it that
people thought and talked of Luce as a priest, consulted him
in the affairs of their souls and resorted to him for the sacraments—whereas
they thought of George only as a parson, paid
him subscriptions and asked him to tea?</p>

<p class='c015'>He was still wondering when they came to the cottage where
the Rector lived—instead of in the twenty-five-roomed Rectory
which the Parish provided, with an endowment of a hundred
and fifty pounds a year. They paused awkwardly at the door,
and the awkwardness was increased rather than diminished by
Luce inviting him to come in. George’s first impulse was to
decline—he felt he would rather not have any more of the
other’s constraining company—but the next minute he realised
that he now had the chance of a rest and tea without the preliminary
endurance of a long and dusty walk. So he followed
him in at the door, which opened disconcertingly into the
kitchen, and through the kitchen into the little study-living-room
beyond it.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was not at all like George’s study at Leasan—the floor
had many more books on it than the wall, the little leaded
window looked out into a kitchen garden, and the two armchairs
both appeared so doubtful as possible supports for
George’s substantial figure that he preferred, in spite of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>fatigue, to sit down on the kitchen chair that stood by the
writing-table. He realised for the first time what he had
always known—that Luce was desperately poor, having nothing
but what he could get out of the living. Probably the whole
did not amount to two hundred pounds&#160;... and with post-war
prices&#160;... George decided to double his subscription to the
Diocesan Fund.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meantime he accepted a cigarette which was only just not
a Woodbine, and tried to look as if he saw nothing extraordinary
in the poverty-stricken room. He thought it would be
only charitable to put the other at his ease.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Convenient little place you’ve got here,” he remarked—“better
for a single man than that barrack of a Rectory.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I could never have lived in the Rectory. I wonder you
manage to live in yours.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George muttered something indistinct about private means.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s difficult enough to live here,” continued Luce—“I
couldn’t do it if it wasn’t for what people give me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are your parishioners generous?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think they are, considering they’re mostly poor people.
The Pannells across the road often send me over some of their
Sunday dinner in a covered dish.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George was speechless.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And I once found a hamper in the road outside the gate.
But after I’d thanked God and eaten half a fowl and drunk a
bottle of claret, I found it had dropped off the carrier’s cart
and there was no end of a fuss.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Er—er—hum.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a knock at the outer door, and before Luce could
say “Come in,” the door of the study opened and a small boy
stuck his head in.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Please, Father, could you lend us your ink?—Mother wants
to write a letter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, certainly, Tom—take it—there it is; but don’t forget to
bring it back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The small boy said nothing, but snatched his booty and went
out.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“Are your people—er—responsive?” asked George.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Responsive to what?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well—er—to you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, not at all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then how do you get them to come to church?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t—Our Lord does.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George coughed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They come to church because they know they’ll always find
Him there—in spite of me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George could not keep back the remark that Reservation was
theologically indefensible.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is it?” Luce did not seem much interested. “But I don’t
keep the Blessed Sacrament in my church for purposes of
theology, but for practical use. Suppose you were to die tonight—where
would you get your last Communion from if not
from my tabernacle?”</p>

<p class='c015'>George winced.</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is the only church in the rural deanery where the
Blessed Sacrament is reserved and the holy oils are kept. The
number of people who die without the sacraments must be
appalling.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George had never been appalled by it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But why do you reserve publicly?” he asked—“that’s not
primitive or catholic—to reserve for purposes of worship.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t reserve for purposes of worship—I reserve for
Communion. But I can’t prevent people from worshipping
Our Lord. Nobody could—not all the Deans of all the
cathedrals in England. Oh, I know you think my church
dreadful—everybody does. Those statues&#160;... well, I own
they’re hideous. But so are all the best parlours in Vinehall.
And I want the people to feel that the church is their Best
Parlour—which they’ll never do if I decorate it in Anglican
good taste, supposing always I could afford to do so. I want
them to feel at home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you find all this helps to make them regular communicants?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not as I’d like, of course; but we’re only beginning. Most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of them come once a month—though a few come every week.
I’ve only one daily communicant—a boy who works on Ellenwhorne
Farm and comes here every evening to cook my supper
and have it with me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George was beginning to feel uncomfortable in this strange
atmosphere—also he was most horribly wanting his tea. Possibly,
as Luce had supper instead of dinner, he took tea later
than usual.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course,” continued the Rector, “some people in this
place don’t like our ways, and don’t come to church here at all.
Some of my parishioners go to you, just as some of yours
come to me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mean my brother Gervase?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wasn’t thinking of him particularly, but he certainly does
come.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The Mounts brought him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“In the first instance, I believe. I hope you don’t feel hurt
at his coming here—but he told me he hadn’t been to church
for over a year, so I thought....”</p>

<p class='c015'>Not a sign of triumph, not a sign of shame—and not a sign
of tea. It suddenly struck George as a hitherto undreamed-of
possibility that Luce did not take tea. His whole life seemed
so different from anything George had known that it was quite
conceivable that he did not. Anyhow the Vicar of Leasan
must be going—the long shadows of some poplars lay over the
garden and were darkening the little room into an early twilight.
He rose to depart.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I must be off, I suppose. Glad to have had a chat.
Come and preach for me one day,” he added rashly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“With pleasure—but I warn you, I’m simply hopeless as a
preacher.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, never mind, never mind,” said George—“all the better—I
mean my people will enjoy the change—at least I mean——”</p>

<p class='c015'>He grabbed desperately at his hat, and followed his host
through the kitchen to the cottage door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here’s Noakes coming up the street to cook supper,” said
Luce—“I didn’t know it was so late.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>George stared rather hard at the Daily Communicant—having
never to his knowledge seen such a thing. He was
surprised and a little disappointed to find only a heavy, fair-haired
young lout, whose face was the face of the district—like
a freckled moon.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m a bit early tonight, Father; but Maaster sent me over to
Dixter wud their roots, and he said it wun’t worth me coming
back and I’d better go straight on here. I thought maybe I
could paint up the shed while the stuff’s boiling.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s a good idea—thanks, Noaky.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Father, there’s a couple of thrushes nesting again by the
Mocksteeple. It’s the first time I’ve seen them nest in the fall.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s the warm weather we’ve been having.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Surelye, but I’m sorry for them when it turns cold....
Father, have you heard?—the Rangers beat the Hastings
United by four goals to one....”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 17</h3>

<p class='c014'>When George had walked out of the village he felt better—he
no longer breathed that choking atmosphere of a different
world, in which lived daily communicants, devout children, and
clergymen who hadn’t always enough to eat. It was not, of
course, the first time that he had seen poverty among the clergy,
but it was the first time he had not seen it decently covered up.
Luce seemed totally unashamed of his&#160;... had not made the
slightest effort to conceal it&#160;... his cottage was, except for
the books, just the cottage of a working-man; indeed it was not
so comfortable as the homes of many working men.</p>

<p class='c015'>George began to wonder exactly how much difference it
would have made if he had been poor instead of well-to-do—if
he had been too poor to live in his comfortable vicarage,
too poor to decorate his church in “Anglican good taste”&#160;...
not that he wouldn’t rather have left it bare than decorate it
like Vinehall&#160;... what nonsense Luce had talked to justify
himself! The church wasn’t the village’s Best Parlour&#160;...
or was it?...</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>He felt quite tired when he reached Leasan, and Rose scolded
him—“You’d much better have come with me to the Parishes.”...
However, it was good to sit at his dinner-table and eat
good food off good china, and drink his water out of eighteenth-century
glass that he had picked up in Ashford.... Luce was
not a total abstainer, judging by that story of the claret....
It is true that the creaking tread of the Raw Girl and the way
she breathed down his neck when she handed the vegetables
made him think less disparagingly of the domestic offices of
the Daily Communicant; but somehow the Raw Girl fitted into
the scheme of things—it was only fitting that local aspirants for
“service” should be trained at the Vicarage—whereas farm-boys
who came in to cook your supper and then sat down and
ate it with you&#160;... the idea was only a little less disturbing
than the idea of farm-boys coming daily to the altar.... He
wondered if Rose would say it was un-English.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, by the way, George”—Rose really was saying—“a
message came down from Conster while you were out, asking
you to go up there after dinner tonight.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George’s illness had brought about a kind of artificial peace
between the Manor and the Vicarage.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What is it now? Have you been invited too?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—I think Sir John wants to speak to you about something.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Whatever can it be?—Mary’s in Switzerland. It can’t be
anything to do with her again.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—I believe it’s something to do with Gervase. I saw
Doris this evening and she tells me Sir John has found out
that Gervase goes to confession.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Does he?—I didn’t know he’d got as far as that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—he goes to Mr. Luce. Mrs. Wade saw him waiting
his turn last Saturday when she was in Vinehall church taking
rubbings of the Oxenbridge brass. I suppose she must have
mentioned it when she went to tea at Conster yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And my father wants me to interfere?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course—you’re a clergyman.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’m not going to.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“George, don’t talk such nonsense. Why, you’ve been complaining
about your father’s disrespect for your priesthood, and
now when he’s showing you that he does respect it——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s showing it no respect if he thinks I’d interfere in a
case like this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But surely you’ve a right—Gervase is your brother and he
doesn’t ever come to your church.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think it would be unwise for me to be my brother’s
confessor.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It would be ridiculous. Whoever thought of such a thing?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then why shouldn’t he go to Luce?—and as for my church,
he hasn’t been to any church for a year, so if Luce can get him
to go to his&#160;... or rather if Our Lord can get him to go to
Luce’s church....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I do hope it won’t rain tomorrow, as I’d thought of going
into Hastings by the ’bus.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Rose had abrupt ways of changing the conversation when
she thought it was becoming indelicate.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 18</h3>

<p class='c014'>George went up to Conster after all. Rose finally persuaded
him, and pushed him into his overcoat. She was anxious that
he should not give fresh offence at the Manor; also she was in
her own way jealous for his priestly honour and eager that he
should vindicate it by exercising its functions when they were
wanted instead of when they were not.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was no family council assembled over Gervase as
there had been over Mary. Only his father and mother were
in the drawing-room when George arrived. Gervase was a
minor in the Alard household, and religion a minor matter in
the Alard world—no questions of money or marriage, those
two arch-concerns of human life, were involved. It was merely
a case of stopping a silly boy making a fool of himself and
his family by going ways which were not the ways of squires.
Not that Sir John did not think himself quite capable of
stopping Gervase without any help from George, but neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>had he doubted his capacity to deal with Mary without summoning
a family council. It was merely the Alard tradition
that the head should act through the members, that his despotism
should be as it were mediated, showing thus his double
power both over the rebel and the forces he employed for his
subjection.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here you are, George—I was beginning to wonder if Rose
had forgotten to give you my message. I want you to talk to
that ass Gervase. It appears that he’s gone and taken to
religion, on the top of a dirty trade and my eldest son’s ex-fiancée.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And you want me to talk him out of it?” George was
occasionally sarcastic when tired.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not out of religion, of course. Could hardly mean that.
But there’s religion and religion. There’s yours and there’s
that fellow Luce’s.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” said George, “there’s mine and there’s Luce’s.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, yours is all right—go to church on Sundays—very
right and proper in your own parish—set a good example and
all that. But when it comes to letting religion interfere with
your private life, then I say it’s time it was stopped. I’ve
nothing against Luce personally——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I think he’s a perfectly dreadful man,” broke in Lady
Alard—“he came to tea once, and talked about God—in the
drawing-room!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear, I think this is a subject which would be all the
better without your interference.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, if a mother hasn’t a right to interfere in the question
of her child’s religion....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You did your bit when you taught him to say his prayers—I
daresay that was what started all the mischief.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“John, if you’re going to talk to me like this I shall leave
the room.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I believe I’ve already suggested such a course once or twice
this evening.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Lady Alard rose with dignity and trailed to the door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sure I hope you’ll be able to manage him,” she said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>bitterly to George as she went out, “but as far as I’m concerned
I’d much rather you argued him out of his infatuation
for Stella Mount.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There is always someone in my family in love with Stella
Mount,” said Sir John, “and it’s better that it should be
Gervase than Peter or George, who are closer to the title, and,
of course, let me hasten to add, married men. But this is the
first case of religious mania we’ve ever had in the house—therefore
I’d rather George concentrated on that. Will you
ask Mr. Gervase to come here?”—to the servant who answered
his ring.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mr. Gervase is in the garage, sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Send him along.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase had been cleaning the Ford lorry, having been given
to understand that his self-will and eccentricity with regard to
Ashford were to devolve no extra duties on the chauffeur.
His appearance, therefore, when he entered the drawing-room,
was deplorable. He wore a dirty suit of overalls, his hands
were black with oil and grime, and his hair was hanging into
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How dare you come in like that, sir?” shouted Sir John.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sorry, sir—I thought you wanted me in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So I do—but I didn’t know you were looking like a sweep.
Why can’t you behave like other people after dinner?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I had to clean the car, sir. But I’ll go and wash.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, stay where you are—George wants to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George did not look as if he did.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s about this new folly of yours,” continued Sir John.
“George was quite horrified when I told him you’d been to
confession.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, come, not ‘horrified’,” said George uneasily—“it was
only the circumstances.... Thought you might have stuck to
your parish church.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And <em>you</em>’d have heard his confession!” sneered Sir John.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, sir, the Prayer Book is pretty outspoken in its commission
to the priest to absolve——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you’ve never heard a confession in your life.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>This was true, and for the first time George was stung by it.
He suddenly felt his anger rising against Luce, who had enjoyed
to the full those sacerdotal privileges which George now
saw he had missed. His anger gave him enough heat to take
up the argument.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not concerned to find out how Luce could bring himself
to influence you when you have a brother in orders, but I’m
surprised you shouldn’t have seen the disloyalty of your conduct.
Here you are forsaking your parish church, which I
may say is also your family church, and traipsing across the
country to a place where they have services exciting enough
to suit you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sorry, George. I know that if I’d behaved properly
I’d have asked your advice about all this. But you see I was
the heathen in his blindness, and if it hadn’t been for Father
Luce I’d be that still.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re telling me I’ve neglected you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not at all—no one could have gone for me harder than you
did. But, frankly, if I’d seen nothing more of religion than
what I saw at your church I don’t think I’d ever have bothered
about it much.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not spectacular enough for you, eh?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I knew you’d say something like that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, isn’t it true?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then may I ask in what way the religion of Vinehall is so
superior to the religion of Leasan?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Just because it isn’t the religion of Vinehall—it’s the religion
of the whole world. It’s a religion for everybody, not
just for Englishmen. When I was at school I thought religion
was simply a kind of gentlemanly aid to a decent life. After
a time you find out that sort of life can be lived just as easily
without religion—that good form and good manners and good
nature will pull the thing through without any help from
prayers and sermons. But when I saw Catholic Christianity
I saw that it pointed to a life which simply couldn’t be lived
without its help—that it wasn’t just an aid to good behaviour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>but something which demanded your whole life, not only in
the teeth of what one calls evil, but in the teeth of that very
decency and good form and good nature which are the religion
of most Englishmen.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“In other words and more briefly,” said Sir John, “you fell
in love with a pretty girl.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase’s face darkened with a painful flush, and George
felt sorry for him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t deny,” he said rather haltingly, “that, if it hadn’t
been for Stella I should never have gone to Vinehall church.
But I assure you the thing isn’t resting on that now. I’ve
nothing to gain from Stella by pleasing her. We’re not on
that footing at all. She never tried to persuade me, either. It’s
simply that after I’d seen only a little of the Catholic faith I
realised that it was what I’d always unconsciously believed&#160;... in my heart.... It was my childhood’s faith—all the
things I’d ‘loved long since and lost awhile.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But don’t you see,” said George, suddenly finding his feet
in the argument, “that you’ve just put your finger on the weak
spot of the whole thing? This ‘Catholic faith’ as you call it
was unconsciously your faith as a child—well, now you ought
to go on and leave all that behind you. ‘When I became a man
I put away childish things.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And ‘whosoever will not receive the kingdom of heaven as
a little child shall in no wise enter therein.’ It’s no good
quoting texts at me, George—we might go on for ever like that.
What I mean is that I’ve found what I’ve always been looking
for, and it’s made Our Lord real to me, as He’s never been
since I was a child—and now the whole of life seems real in
a way it didn’t before—I don’t know how to explain, but it
does. And it wasn’t only the romantic side of things which
attracted me—it was the hard side too. In fact the hardness
impressed me almost before I saw all the beauty and joy and
romance. It was when we were having all that argument about
Mary’s divorce.... I saw then that the Catholic Church
wasn’t afraid of a Hard Saying. I thought, ‘Here’s a religion
which wouldn’t be afraid to ask anything of me—whether it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>was to shut myself up for life in a monastery or simply to
make a fool of myself.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, on the whole, I’m glad you contented yourself with
the latter,” said Sir John.</p>

<p class='c015'>George said—“I think it’s a pity Gervase didn’t go to
Oxford.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Whether he’s been to Oxford or not, he’s at least supposed
to be a gentleman. He may try to delude himself by driving
off every morning in a motor lorry, but he does in fact belong
to an old and honourable house, and as head of that house I
object to his abandoning his family’s religion.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I never had my family’s religion, Sir—I turned to Catholicism
from no religion at all. I daresay it’s more respectable
to have no religion than the Catholic religion, but I don’t mind
about being respectable—in fact, I’d rather not.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re absorbing your new principles pretty fast—already
you seem to have forgotten all family ties and obligations.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t see that my family has any right to settle my religion
for me—at least I’m Protestant enough to believe I must find
my own salvation, and not expect my family to pass it on to
me. I think this family wants to do too much.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What d’you mean, Sir?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It wants to settle all the private affairs of its members.
There’s Peter—you wouldn’t let him marry Stella. There’s
Mary, you wouldn’t let her walk out by the clean gate——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hold your tongue! Who are you to discuss Peter’s affairs
with me? And as for Mary—considering your disgraceful
share in the business....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right, Sir. I’m only trying to point out that the family
is much more autocratic than the Church.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I thought you said that what first attracted you to the
Church was the demands it made on you. George!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Am I conducting this argument or are you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You seem better able to do it than I, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, what did I send you to Oxford for, and to a theological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>college for, and put you into this living for, if you can’t
argue a schoolboy out of the Catholic faith?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve pointed out to Gervase, Sir, that the so-called Catholic
movement is not the soundest intellectually, and that I don’t see
why he should walk three miles to Vinehall on Sundays when
he has everything necessary to salvation at his parish church.
I can’t go any further than that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How d’you mean?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t reason him out of his faith—why should I? On the
contrary, I’m very glad he’s found it. I don’t agree with all
he believes—I think some of it is extravagant—but I see at
least he’s got a religion which will make him happy and keep
him straight, and really there’s no cause for me to interfere
with it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George was purple.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re a fool!” cried Sir John—“you’re a much bigger
fool than Gervase, because at least he goes the whole hog,
while you as usual are sitting on the fence. It’s just the same
now as when I asked you to speak to Mary. If you’d go all
the way I’d respect you, or if you’d go none of the way I’d
respect you, but you go half way.... Gervase can go all the
way to the Pope or to the devil, whichever he pleases—I don’t
care now—he can’t be as big a fool as you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He turned and walked out of the room, banging the door
furiously behind him. The brothers were left alone together.
Gervase heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come along with me to the garage,” he said to George,
“and help me take the Ford’s carburetor down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, thanks,” said George dully—“I’m going home.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 19</h3>

<p class='c014'>He had failed again. As he walked through the thick yellow
light of the Hunter’s Moon to Leasan, he saw himself as
a curiously feeble and ineffective thing. It was not only that
he had failed to persuade his brother by convincing arguments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>or that he had failed once more to inspire his father with any
sort of respect for his office, but he had somehow failed in
regard to his own soul, and all his other failures were merely
branches of that most bitter root.</p>

<p class='c015'>He had been unable to convince Gervase because he was not
convinced himself—he had been unable to inspire his father
because he was not inspired himself. All his life he had stood
for moderation, toleration, broad-mindedness&#160;... and here he
was, so moderate that no one would believe him, so tolerant
that no one would respect him, so broad-minded that the water
of life lay as it were stagnant in a wide and shallow pond
instead of rushing powerfully between the rocky, narrow banks
of a single heart....</p>

<p class='c015'>He found Rose waiting for him in the hall.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How late you are! I’ve shut up. They must have kept
you an awful time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve been rather slow coming home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Tired?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I am a bit.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How did you get on? I expect Gervase was cheeky.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Only a little.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you talked him round?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t say that I have. And I don’t know that I want to.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“George!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Rose had put out the hall lamp, and her voice sounded hoarse
and ghostly in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, the boy’s got some sort of religion at last after being
a heathen for years.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not sure that he wouldn’t be better as a heathen than
believing the silly, extravagant things he does. I don’t suppose
for a minute it’s gone really deep.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The sort of thing couldn’t. What he wants is a sober,
sensible, practical religion——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Soup?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“George!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, that’s what Mary called it. And when I see that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>boy has found adventure, discipline and joy in faith, am I to
take it away and offer him soup?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“George, I’m really shocked to hear you talk like that.
Please turn down the landing light—I can’t reach it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Religion is romance,” said George’s voice in the thick
darkness of the house—“and I’ve been twelve years trying to
turn it into soup....”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 20</h3>

<p class='c014'>Rose made up her mind that her husband must be ill, therefore
she forebore further scolding or argument, and hurried
him into bed with a cup of malted milk.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ve done too much,” she said severely—“you said you
didn’t feel well enough to come with me to the Parishes, and
then you went tramping off to Vinehall. What can you expect
when you’re so silly? Now drink this and go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George went to sleep. But in the middle of the night he
awoke. All the separate things of life, all the differences of
time and space, seemed to have run together in one sharp
moment. He was not in the bed, he was not in the room&#160;...
the room seemed to be in him, for he saw every detail of its
trim mediocrity&#160;... and there lay George Alard on the bed
beside a sleeping Rose&#160;... but he was George Alard right
enough, for George Alard’s pain was his, that queer constricting
pain which was part of the functions of his body, of every
breath he drew and every beat of his heart&#160;... he was lying
in bed&#160;... gasping, suffering, dying&#160;... this was what it
meant to die.... Rose! Rose!</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c015'>Rose bent over her husband; her big plaits swung in his face.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What’s the matter, George?—are you ill?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you ill?” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then she groped for a match, and as soon as she saw his
face, jumped out of bed.</p>

<p class='c015'>No amount of bell-ringing would wake the Raw Girls, so
Rose leaped upstairs to their attic, and beat on the door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Annie! Mabel! Get up and dress quickly, and go to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Conster Manor and telephone for Dr. Mount. Your master’s
ill.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sundry stampings announced the beginning of Annie’s and
Mabel’s toilet, and Rose ran downstairs to her husband. She
lit the lamp and propped him up in bed so that he could
breathe more easily, thrusting her own pillows under his neck.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Poor old man!—Are you better?” Her voice had a new
tender quality—she drew her hand caressingly under his chin—“Poor
old man!—I’ve sent for Dr. Mount.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Send for Luce.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It was the first time he had spoken, and the words jerked
out of him drily, without expression.</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right, all right—but we want the doctor first. There,
the girls are ready—hurry up, both of you, as fast as you can,
and ask the butler, or whoever lets you in, to ’phone. It’s
Vinehall 21—but they’re sure to know.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She went back into the room and sat down again beside
George, taking his hand. He looked dreadfully ill, his face
was blue and he struggled for breath. Rose was not the sort
of woman who could sit still for long—in a moment or two
she sprang to her feet, and went to the medicine cupboard.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I believe some brandy would do you good—it’s allowed in
case of illness, you know.”</p>

<p class='c015'>George did not seem to care whether it was allowed or not.
Rose gave him a few drops, and he seemed better. She
smoothed his pillows and wiped the sweat off his face.</p>

<p class='c015'>She had hardly sat down again when the hall door opened
and there was the sound of footsteps on the stairs. It must
be the girls coming back—Rose suddenly knew that she was
desperately glad even of their company. She went to the
door, and looked out on the landing. The light that streamed
over her shoulder from the bedroom showed her the scared,
tousled faces of Gervase and Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What’s up, Rose?—Is he very bad?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m afraid so. Have you ’phoned Dr. Mount?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—he’s coming along at once. We thought perhaps we
could do something?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“I don’t know what there is to do. I’ve given him some
brandy. Come in.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They followed her into the room and stood at the foot of
the bed. Jenny, who had learned First Aid during the war,
suggested propping him higher with a chair behind the pillows.
She and Gervase looked dishevelled and half asleep in their
pyjamas and great-coats. Rose suddenly realised that she was
not wearing a dressing-gown—she tore it off the foot of the
bed and wrapped it round her. For the first time in her life
she felt scared, cold and helpless. She bent over George and
laid her hand on his, which were clutched together on his
breast.</p>

<p class='c015'>His eyes were wide open, staring over her shoulder at
Gervase.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Luce&#160;...” he said with difficulty—“Luce....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right,” said Gervase—“I’ll fetch him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wouldn’t you rather have Canon Potter, dear?—He could
come in his car.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—Luce&#160;... the only church.... Sacrament....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t you worry—I’ll get him. I’ll go in the Ford.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase was out of the room, leaving Jenny in uneasy
attendance. A few minutes later Doris arrived. She had
wanted to come with the others, but had felt unable to leave
her room without a toilet. She alone of the party was dressed—even
to her boots.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How is he, Rose?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s better now, but I wish Dr. Mount would come.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you think he’ll die?” asked Doris in a penetrating
whisper—“ought I to have woken up Father and Mother?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—of course not. Don’t talk nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I met Gervase on his way to fetch Mr. Luce.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s only because George wanted to see him—very
natural to want to see a brother clergyman when you’re ill.
But it’s only a slight attack—he’s much better already.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She made expressive faces at Doris while she spoke.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s Dr. Mount!” cried Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>A car sounded in the Vicarage drive and a few moments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>later the doctor was in the room. His examination of George
was brief. He took out some capsules.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What are you going to do?” asked Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Give him a whiff of amyl nitrate.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s not serious?&#160;... he’s not going to....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ought we to fetch Father and Mother?” choked Doris.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t suppose Lady Alard would be able to come at this
hour—but I think you might fetch Sir John.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Rose suddenly began to cry. Then the sight of her own
tears frightened her, and she was as suddenly still.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll go,” said Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—you’d better let me go,” said Doris—“I’ve got my
boots on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where’s Gervase?” asked Dr. Mount.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s gone to fetch Mr. Luce from Vinehall—George asked
for him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How did he go? Has he been gone long?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He went in his car—he ought to be back quite soon. Oh,
doctor, do you think it’s urgent&#160;... I mean&#160;... he seems
easier now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Dr. Mount did not speak—he bent over George, who lay
motionless and exhausted, but seemingly at peace.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is he conscious?” asked Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perfectly, I should say. But don’t let him speak.”</p>

<p class='c015'>With a queer abandonment, unlike herself, Rose climbed on
the bed, curling herself up beside George and holding his hand.
The minutes ticked by. Jenny, feeling awkward and self-conscious,
sat in the basket armchair by the fireplace. Dr.
Mount moved quietly about the room—as in a dream Rose
watched him set two lighted candles on the little table by the
bed. There was absolute silence, broken only by the ticking
of the clock. Rose began to feel herself again—the attack was
over—George would be all right—it was a pity that Gervase
had gone for Mr. Luce. She began to feel herself ridiculous,
curled up with George in the bed&#160;... she had better get out
before Sir John came and sneered at her very useful flannel
dressing-gown&#160;... then suddenly, as she looked down on it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>George’s face changed—once more the look of anguish convulsed
it, and he started up in bed, clutching his side and
fighting for his breath.</p>

<p class='c015'>It seemed an age, though it was really only a few minutes,
that the fight lasted. Rose had no time to be afraid or even
pitiful, for Dr. Mount apparently could do nothing without
her—as she rather proudly remembered afterwards, he
wouldn’t let Jenny help at all, but turned to Rose for everything.
She had just begun to think how horrible the room
smelt with drugs and brandy, when there was a sound of wheels
below in the drive.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s Gervase,” said Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Or perhaps it’s Sir John....”</p>

<p class='c015'>But it was Gervase—the next minute he came into the room.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve brought him,” he said—“is everything ready?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, quite ready,” said Dr. Mount.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Rose saw standing behind Gervase outside the door a
tall stooping figure in a black cloak, under which its arms were
folded over something that it carried on its breast.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Lord had come suddenly to Leasan Parsonage.</p>

<p class='c015'>Immediately panic seized her, a panic which became strangely
fused with anger. She sprang forward and would have shut
the door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t come in—you’re frightening him—he mustn’t be
disturbed.... Oh, he’d be better, if you’d only let him
alone....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She felt someone take her arm and gently pull her aside—the
next moment she was unaccountably on her knees, and
crying as if her heart would break. She saw that the intruder
no longer stood framed in the doorway—he was beside the bed,
bending over George, his shadow thrown monstrous on the
ceiling by the candle-light.... What was he saying?...</p>

<p class='c015'>“Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my
roof....”</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>§ 1</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>George Alard’s death affected his brother Peter out of all
proportion to his life. While George was alive, Peter had
looked upon him rather impatiently as a nuisance and a humbug—a
nuisance because of his attempts to thrust parochial
honours on his unwilling brother, a humbug because religion
was so altogether remote from Peter’s imagination that he
could not credit the sincerity of any man (he was not so sure
about women) who believed in it. But now that George was
dead he realised that, in spite of his drawbacks, he had been
a link in the Alard chain, and that link now was broken. If
Peter now died childless, his heir would be Gervase—Gervase
with his contempt of the Alard traditions and ungentlemanly
attitude towards life. Gervase was capable of selling the whole
place. It would be nothing to him if Sir Gervase Alard lived
in a villa at Hastings or a flat at West Kensington, or a small-holding
at his own park gates, whatever was the fancy of the
moment—no, he had forgotten—it was to be a garage—“Sir
Gervase Alard. Cars for hire. Taxies. Station Work.”</p>

<p class='c015'>These considerations made him unexpectedly tender towards
his sister-in-law Rose when she moved out of Leasan Parsonage
into a small house she had taken in the village. Rose
could not bear the thought of being cut off from Alard, of
being shut out of its general councils, of being deprived of its
comfortable hospitality half as daughter, half as guest. Also
she saw the advantages of the great house for her children,
the little girls. Her comparative poverty—for George had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>left her much—made it all the more necessary that she should
prop herself against Conster. Living there under its wing, she
would have a far better position than if she set up her independence
in some new place where she would be only a clergyman’s
widow left rather badly off.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter admired Rose for these tactics. She would cling to
Alard, even in the certainty of being perpetually meddled with
and snubbed. He lent her his car to take her and her more
intimate belongings to the new house, promised her the loan
of it whenever she wanted, and gave her a general invitation
to Starvecrow, rather to Vera’s disquiet. He had hated Rose
while his brother was alive—he had looked upon her as a busybody
and an upstart—but now he loved her for her loyalty,
self-interested though it was, and was sorry that she had for
ever lost her chance of becoming Lady Alard.</p>

<p class='c015'>He made one or two efforts to impress Gervase with a sense
of his responsibility as heir-apparent, but was signally unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear old chap,” said his irreverent brother—“you’ll
probably have six children, all boys, so it’s cruel to raise my
hopes, which are bound to be dashed before long.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter looked gloomy. Gervase had hit him on a tender,
anxious spot. He had now been married more than a year,
and there was no sign of his hopes being fulfilled. He told
himself he was an impatient fool—Jewish women were proverbially
mothers of strong sons. But the very urgency of his
longing made him mistrust its fulfilment—Vera was civilised
out of race—she ran too much to brains. She had, to his
smothered consternation, produced a small volume of poems
and essays, which she had had typed and sent expectantly to
a publisher. Peter was not used to women doing this sort of
thing, and it alarmed him. If they did it, he could not conceive
how they could also do the more ordinary and useful
things that were expected of them.</p>

<p class='c015'>His father laughed at him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter—you’re a yokel. Your conception of women is on
a level with Elias’s and Lambard’s.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“No, it isn’t, Sir—that’s just what’s the matter. I can’t feel
cocksure about things most men feel cocksure about. That’s
why I wish you’d realise that there’s every chance of Gervase
coming into the property——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear Peter, you are the heir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, Sir. But if I don’t leave a son to come after me....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I refuse to bother about what may happen forty
years after I’m dead. If you live to my age—and there’s no
reason you shouldn’t, as you’re a healthy man—it’ll be time to
think about an heir. Gervase may be dead before that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s almost young enough to be my son.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But what in God’s name do you want me to do with him?
Am I to start already preparing him for his duties as Sir
Gervase Alard?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You might keep a tighter hand on him, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Damn it all! Are you going to teach me how to bring up
my own son?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, Sir. But what I feel is that you’re not bringing him
up as you brought up George and me and poor Hugh—you’re
letting him go his own way. You don’t bother about him
because you don’t think he’s a chance of coming into the
property. And two of the three of us have got out of his
way since he was sixteen.... He’s precious near it now.
And yet you let him have his head over that engineering
business, and now you’ve given way about his religion.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The engineering business was settled long ago, and has
saved us a lot of money—more than paid for that fool Mary’s
fling. What we’ve spent on the roundabouts we’ve saved on
the swings all right. As for the religion—he’ll grow out of
that all the quicker for my leaving him alone. I got poor
George to talk to him, but that didn’t do any good, so I’ve
decided to let him sicken himself, which he’s bound to do
sooner or later the way he goes at it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The fact is, Sir—you’ve never looked upon Gervase as the
heir, and you can’t do so now, though he virtually is the heir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Indeed he isn’t. The heir is master Peter John Alard,
whose christening mug I’m going to buy next Christmas”—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Sir John made one or two other remarks in his coarse
Victorian fashion.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter knew he was a fool to be thinking about his heir.
His father, though an old man, was still hale—his gout only
served to show what a fighter he was; and he himself was a
man in the prime of life, healthy and sound. Was it that the
war had undermined his sense of security?—He caught uneasy
glimpses of another reason, hidden deeper&#160;... a vague sense
that it would be awful to have sacrificed so much for Alard
and Starvecrow, and find his sacrifice in vain—to have given
up Stella Mount (who would certainly not have given him a
book instead of a baby) only that his brother Gervase might
some day degrade Alard, sell Starvecrow and (worst of all)
marry Stella.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 2</h3>

<p class='c014'>For in his heart Peter too expected Gervase to marry Stella.
He knew there was a most unsuitable difference in their ages,
but it weighed little against his expectation. He expected
Gervase to marry Stella for the same reason that he expected
to die without leaving an heir—because he feared it. Besides,
his family talked continually of the possibility, and here again
showed that obtuseness in the matter of Gervase that he deplored.
They had no objection to his marrying Stella Mount,
because he was the younger son, and it wasn’t imperative for
him to marry money, as it had been for Peter. Another
reason for Peter’s expectation was perhaps that he could not
understand a man being very much in Stella’s society and not
wanting to marry her. She was pretty, gentle, capable, comfortable,
and oh! so sweet to love—she would make an excellent
wife, even to a man many years younger than herself;
she would be a mother to him as well as to his children.</p>

<p class='c015'>This did not mean that Peter was dissatisfied with Vera.
His passion for her had not cooled at the end of a year. She
was still lovely and desirable. But he now realised definitely
that she did not speak his language or think his thoughts—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>book of poems was a proof of it, if he had required other proof
than her attitude towards Starvecrow. Vera was all right
about the family—she respected Alard—but she was remarkably
out of tune with the farm. She could not understand the
year-in-year-out delight it was to him. She had even suggested
that they should take a house in London for the winter—and
miss the ploughing of the clays, the spring sowings, and the
early lambing! “The country’s so dreary in winter,” she had
said.</p>

<p class='c015'>This had frightened Peter—he found it difficult to adjust
himself to such an outlook&#160;... it was like the first morning
when he had found she meant always to have breakfast in
bed.... Stella would never have suggested that he should miss
the principal feasts of the farmer’s year.... But Stella had
not Vera’s beauty or power or brilliance—nor had she (to
speak crudely) Vera’s money, and if he had married her
Starvecrow would probably now have been in the auction
market.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides, though loyal to Starvecrow, Stella had always been
flippant and profane on the subject of the family, and in this
respect Vera was all that Peter could wish. She was evidently
proud of her connection with Alard—she kept as close
under its wing as Rose, and for more disinterested reasons.
She had her race’s natural admiration for an ancient family
and a noble estate, she felt honoured by her alliance and her
privileges—she would make a splendid Lady Alard of Conster
Manor, though a little unsatisfactory as Mrs. Peter Alard of
Starvecrow Farm.</p>

<p class='c015'>As part of her lien with Alard, Vera had become close
friends with Jenny. It was she who told Peter that Jenny had
broken off her engagement to Jim Parish.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I didn’t know she was engaged to him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Peter, they’ve been engaged more than three years.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I never knew anything about it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You must have—you all did, though you chose to ignore it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I always thought it was just an understanding.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“That’s the same thing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Indeed it isn’t!”—At that rate he had been engaged to
Stella and had behaved like a swine.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, whatever it was, she’s through with it now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What did she turn him down for?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, simply that there was no chance of their marrying, and
they were getting thoroughly tired of each other.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“A nice look-out if they’d married.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That would have been different. They might not have got
tired of each other then. It’s these long engagements, that
drag on and on without hope of an ending. I must say I’m
sorry for poor Jenny. She’s been kept hanging about for three
years, and she’s had frightfully little sympathy from anyone—except
perhaps Mary. They were all too much afraid that if
they encouraged her she’d dash off and get married on a thousand
a year or some such pittance.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve always understood Parish paid three hundred a year
towards the interest on the Cock Marling mortgages—that
would leave him with only seven hundred,” said Peter gravely.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Impossible, of course. They’d have been paupers. But do
you know that till I came down here I’d no idea how fashionable
mortgages are among the best county families?”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 3</h3>

<p class='c014'>Peter did not meet Jenny till some days later. She had
been to see Vera, and came out of the house just as Peter was
talking to young Godfrey, the farmer of Fourhouses. This
farm did not belong to the Alards—it stood on the southern
fringe of their land in Icklesham parish. At one time Sir
William Alard had wanted to buy it, but the owners held tight,
and his grandchildren lived to be thankful for the extra hundred
acres’ weight that had been spared them. Now, the situation
was reversed, and the Godfreys were wanting to buy the
thirty acres of Alard land immediately adjoining Fourhouses.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir John was willing to sell, and the only difficulty was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>usual one of the mortgage. Godfrey, however, still wished to
buy, for he believed that the land would double its value if
adequate money was spent on it, and this he was prepared to
do, for his farm had prospered under the government guarantees.
For generations the Godfreys had been a hard-working
and thrifty set, and the war—though it had taken Ben Godfrey
himself out to Mesopotamia—had made Fourhouses flourish as
it had never done since the repeal of the Corn Laws.</p>

<p class='c015'>The problem became entirely one of price, and Peter had
done his best to persuade his father not to stand out too stiffly
over this. The family badly needed hard cash—the expenses
of Mary’s suit had been heavy, and as their money was tied up
in land it was always difficult to put their hand on a large sum.
Here was a chance which might never happen again—for no
one was likely to want the Snailham land under its present
disabilities, except Godfrey, whose farm it encroached on. If
they did not sell it now, it might become necessary (and this
was Peter’s great fear) to sell the free lands of Starvecrow.
Therefore if the Snailham land brought in the ready money
they wanted, they must try to forget that it was going for little
more than half what Sir William had given for it seventy years
ago.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’ll talk it over with Sir John,” he said to Godfrey,
who was on horseback in the drive. It was then he saw Jenny
coming towards them out of the house.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wait a minute,” he said to her—“I want to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He was uncertain whether or not he ought to introduce the
young farmer to his sister. Godfrey did not call himself a
gentleman farmer—indeed he was inclined to despise the title—but
he came of good old yeoman stock, and his name went back
nearly as far as Alard into the records of Winchelsea.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jenny, this is Mr. Godfrey of Fourhouses—my sister, Miss
Jenny Alard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Godfrey took off his soft hat. He had the typical face of
the Sussex and Kent borders, broad, short-nosed, blue-eyed;
but there was added to it a certain brownness and sharpness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>which might have come from a dash of gipsy blood. A Godfrey
had married a girl of the Boswells in far-back smuggling
days.</p>

<p class='c015'>He and Peter discussed the Snailham snapes a little longer—then
he rode off, and Peter turned to Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I didn’t know you’d come over,” he said, “and I wanted to
talk to you a bit—it’s an age since I’ve seen you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He was feeling a little guilty about his attitude towards
her and Jim Parish—he had, like all the rest of the family,
tried to ignore the business, and he now realised how bitter
it must have been to Jenny to stand alone.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Vera told me that you’d broken off your engagement,” he
added as they walked down the drive.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So it was an engagement, was it?” said Jenny rather pertly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, you yourself know best what it was.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I should have called it an engagement, but as neither his
family nor mine would acknowledge it, perhaps it wasn’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There was no chance of your getting married for years, so
it seemed better not to make it public. I can’t tell you I’m
sorry you’ve broken it off.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I should hardly say it’s broken off—rather that it’s rotted
away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her voice sounded unusually hard, and Peter felt a little
ashamed of himself.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m frightfully sorry, Jenny”—taking her arm—“I’m afraid
we’ve all been rather unsympathetic, but——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase hasn’t. It was he who advised me to end things.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The deuce it was!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—he saw it as I did—simply ridiculous.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So it was, my dear—since you couldn’t get married till
the Lord knows when.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That wasn’t what made it ridiculous. The ridiculous part
was that we could have got married perfectly well if only I
hadn’t been Jenny Alard of Conster Manor and he Jim Parish
of Cock Marling Place.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, he’s got over seven hundred a year. Most young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>couples would look upon that as riches, but it’s poverty to us—partly
because he has to pay away half of it in interest on
mortgages, and partly because we’ve got such an absurd standard
of living that we couldn’t exist on anything less than two
or three thousand.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I hope you’d never be such a fool as to marry on
seven hundred.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s just it—I’m refusing to marry on seven hundred.
But I’ll tell you, Peter—I’d do it like a shot for a man who
didn’t look upon it as a form of suicide. If ever I meet a man
who thinks it enough for him, I promise you it’ll be enough
for me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s all very well, Jenny. But Parish must think of
Cock Marling.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He is thinking of it. It’s Cock Marling that’s separated us
just as Conster separated you and Stella.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter was annoyed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ve no right to say that. What makes you think I
wanted to marry Stella? It’s not fair to Vera to suggest such
a thing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sorry, Peter. I oughtn’t to have said it. But I did
once think.... But anyhow, I’m glad you didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So am I.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And I’m glad I’m not going to marry Jim.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then you needn’t be angry with Cock Marling.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I am—because I know I could have been happy with
Jim if there’d been no Cock Marling. It’s all very well for
you to talk, Peter—but I think.... Oh, these big country
houses make me sick. It’s all the same—everywhere I go I
see the same thing—we’re all cut to a pattern. There’s always
the beautifully kept grounds and the huge mortgaged estate
that’s tumbling to pieces for want of money to spend on it.
Then, when you go in, there are hothouse flowers everywhere,
and beautiful glass and silver—and bad cooking. And we’re
waited on badly because we’re too old-fashioned and dignified
to employ women, so we have the cheapest butler we can get,
helped by a footman taken from the plough. Upstairs the bedrooms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>want painting and papering, but we always have two
cars—though we can’t afford motor traction for our land.
We’re falling to pieces, but we hide the cracks with pots of
flowers. Why can’t we sell our places and live in comfort?
We Alards would be quite well-to-do if we lived in a moderate
sized house with two or three women servants and either a
small car or none at all. We could afford to be happy then.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jenny, you’re talking nonsense. You’re like most women
and can’t see the wood for the trees. If we gave up the cars
tomorrow and sacked Appleby and Pollock and Wills, and sold
the silver and the pictures, it wouldn’t do us the slightest good
in the world. We’d still have the estate, we’d still have to pay
in taxes more than the land brings in to us. You can’t sell land
nowadays, even if it isn’t mortgaged. Besides—damn it all!—why
should we sell it? It’s been ours for centuries, we’ve been
here for centuries, and I for one am proud of it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’m not. I’m ashamed. I tell you, Peter, our day is
over, and we’d better retire, while we can retire gracefully—before
we’re sold up.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nonsense. If we hang on, the value of the land will rise,
we’ll be able to pay off the mortgages—and perhaps some day
this brutal government will see the wickedness of its taxation
and——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why should it? It wants the money—and we’ve no right
to be here. We’ve outlived our day. Instead of developing
the land—we’re ruining it, letting it go to pieces. We can’t
afford to keep our tenants’ farms in order. It’s time we ceased
to own half the country, and the land went back to the people
it used to belong to.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I see you’ve been talking to Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, he and I think alike on this subject.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m quite sure you do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And we’ve made up our minds not to let the family spoil
our lives. It’s taken Jim from me—but that was his fault.
It’s not going to smash me a second time. If I want to marry
a poor man, I shall do so—even if he’s really poor—not only
just what we call poor.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“Well, you and Gervase are a precious couple, that’s all I’ve
got to say.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The next moment he softened towards her, because he remembered
that she was unhappy and spoke out of the bitterness
of her heart. But though he was sorry for her, he had a secret
admiration for Jim Parish, who had refused to desert the
Squires.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 4</h3>

<p class='c014'>He was intensely worried that his sister and brother could
take up such an attitude towards the family. They were young
socialists, anarchists, bolsheviks, and he heartily disapproved
of them. He brooded over Jenny’s words more than was
strictly reasonable. She wasn’t going to let the family spoil
her life, she said—she wasn’t going to sacrifice herself to the
family—she wasn’t going to let the family come between her
and the man she loved as he had let it come between him and
Stella. She’d no right to say that—it wasn’t true. He
couldn’t really have loved Stella or he wouldn’t have sacrificed
her to Alard and Starvecrow. Yes, he would, though—yes, he
had. He had loved her—he wouldn’t say he hadn’t, he
wouldn’t deny the past. He had loved her, but he had deliberately
let her go because to have kept her would have
meant disloyalty to his family. So what Jenny had said was
true.</p>

<p class='c015'>This realisation did not soothe, though he never doubted
the rightness of what he had done. He wondered how much
he had hurt Stella by putting her aside&#160;... poor little Stella—she
had loved him truly, and she had loved Starvecrow. He
had robbed her of both.... He remembered the last scene
between them, their goodbye—in the office at Starvecrow, in the
days of its pitch-pine and bamboo, before he had put in the
Queen Anne bureau and the oak chests. He wondered what
she would think of it now. She would have fitted into Starvecrow
better than Vera&#160;... bah! he’d always realised that, but
it was just as well to remind himself that if he had married
her, there would have been no Starvecrow for her to fit into.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>He hadn’t sacrificed her merely to Alard but also to Starvecrow—and
she had understood that part of the sacrifice. He remembered
her saying, “I understand your selfish reason much
better than your unselfish one.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Well, there was no good brooding over her now. If he had
loved her once, he now loved her no longer&#160;... and if she had
loved him once, she now loved him no longer. She was consoling
herself with Gervase. She might be Lady Alard yet,
and save Starvecrow out of the wreck that her husband would
make of the estate. Peter felt sick.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next day he met her at tea at Conster Manor, whither
he had been asked with Vera to meet George’s successor, the
new Vicar of Leasan. She was sitting on the opposite side of
the room beside the Vicar’s wife—a faded little woman, in
scrappy finery, very different from her predecessor who was
eating her up from her place by Lady Alard. Peter had met
Stella fairly often in public, but had not studied her closely till
today. Today for some reason he wanted to know a great deal
about her—whether she was still attractive, whether she was
happy, whether she was in love with Gervase, though this last
was rather difficult to discover, as Gervase was not there. On
the first two points he soon satisfied himself. She was certainly
attractive—she did not look any older than when he had
fallen in love with her during the last year of the war. Her
round, warmly coloured face and her bright eyes held the
double secret of youth and happiness—yes, he saw that she was
happy. She carried her happiness about with her. After all,
now he came to think of it, she did not lead a particularly
happy life—dispensing for her father and driving his car, it
was dull to say the least. He could not help respecting her
for her happiness, just as he respected her for her bright neat
clothes contrasting so favourably with the floppy fussiness of
bits and ends that adorned the Vicar’s wife.</p>

<p class='c015'>He could not get near her and he could not hear what she
was saying. The floor was held by Mr. Williams, the new
Vicar. The Parsonage couple were indeed the direct contrast
of their predecessors—it was the husband who dominated, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>wife who struggled. Mr. Williams had been a chaplain to the
forces, and considered Christianity the finest sport going. A
breezy, hefty shepherd, he would feed his flock on football and
billiards, as George had fed them on blankets and Parochial
Church Councils. It was inconceivable that anyone in Leasan
should miss the way to heaven.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I believe in being a man among men,” he blew over Sir
John, who was beginning to hate him, though he had chosen
him out of twenty-one applicants—“that’s what you learnt in
France—no fuss, no frills, just playing the game.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’d better have a few words with my youngest son,”
said Sir John, resolving to give him a hard nut to crack—“he’s
turned what used to be called a Puseyite in my young
days, but is now called a Catholic, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“A Zanzibarbarian—what? Oh, he’ll grow out of that.
Boys often get it when they’re young.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And stay young all their lives if they keep it,” said Stella—“I’m
glad Gervase will be always young.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Vicar gave her a look of breezy disapproval. Peter
was vexed too—not because Stella had butted into the conversation
and thrown her opinion across the room, but because
she had gone out of her way to interfere on behalf of Gervase.
It was really rather obvious&#160;... one couldn’t help noticing&#160;... and in bad taste, too, considering Peter was there.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here he is,” said Sir John, as the Ford back-fired a volley
in the drive—“you can start on him now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But Gervase was hungry and wanted his tea. He sat down
beside his mother and Rose, so that he could have a plate
squarely set on the table instead of balancing precarious slices
of cake in his saucer. Peter watched him in a manner which
he hoped was guarded. There was no sign of any special
intelligence between him and Stella—Gervase had included her
in his general salutation, which he had specialised only in the
case of the Vicar and his wife. At first this reassured Peter,
but after a while he realised that it was not altogether a reassuring
sign—Gervase should have greeted Stella more as a
stranger, shaken hands with her as he had shaken hands with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the strangers, instead of including her in the family wave and
grin. They must be on very good terms—familiar terms....</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella rose to go.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you got the car?” asked Gervase.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—Father’s gone over to Dallington in her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let me drive you back—I’ve got Henry Ford outside.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But have you finished your tea? You’ve only eaten half
the cake.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll eat the other half when I come back—it won’t take me
more than a few minutes to run you home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thanks very much, then,” said Stella.</p>

<p class='c015'>She had never been one to refuse a kindness, or say “No,
thanks,” when she meant “Yes, please.” None the less Peter
was angry. He was angry with her for accepting Gervase’s
offer and driving off in his disreputable lorry, and he was
angry with her for that very same happiness which he had
admired her for earlier in the afternoon. It was extremely
creditable of her to be happy when she had nothing to make
her so, when her happiness sprang only from the soil of
her contented heart; but if she was happy because of
Gervase....</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s an elegant fellow, that young son of mine,” said Sir
John, as the lorry drove off amidst retchings and smoke—“No
doubt the day will come when I shall see him drink out of his
saucer.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c014'>The woman Peter loved now left Conster more elegantly
than the woman he had loved once. The Sunbeam floated over
the lane between Conster and Starvecrow, and pulled up noiselessly
outside the house almost directly it had started. Peter
was beginning to feel a little tired of the Sunbeam—he had
hankerings after a lively little two-seater. An eight-cylindered
landaulette driven by a man in livery was all very well for
Vera to pay calls in, or if they wanted to go up to town. But
he wanted something to take him round to farms on business,
and occasionally ship a bag of meal or a load of spiles. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>couldn’t afford both, and if they had the two-seater Vera could
still go out in it to pay her calls—or up to London, for that
matter. But she refused to part with the Sunbeam—it was
her father and mother’s wedding present, and they would be
terribly hurt if she gave it up. Two-seaters were always uncomfortable.
And why did Peter want to go rattling round
to farms?—Couldn’t he send one of his men?—Vera never
would take him seriously as a farmer.</p>

<p class='c015'>This evening, thanks to the Sunbeam, they reached home too
early to dress for dinner. Peter asked Vera to come for a
stroll with him in the orchard, but she preferred the garden
at the back of the house. The garden at Starvecrow used to
be a plot of ragged grass, surrounding a bed of geraniums
from the middle of which unexpectedly rose a pear-tree.
Today it was two green slips of lawn divided by a paved pathway
shaded by a pergola. The April dusk was still warm, still
pricked with the notes of birds, but one or two windows in
the house were lighted, orange squares of warmth and welcome
beyond the tracery of the pergola.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s lovely, isn’t it?” murmured Peter, taking Vera’s arm
under her cloak—“Oh, my dear, you surely wouldn’t be in
London now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” said Vera—“not when it’s fine.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What did you think of Williams?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, he seemed all right—I didn’t talk to him much. But
his wife’s a bore.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I felt sorry for poor Rose, having to welcome her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You needn’t worry—she didn’t do much of that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She had to sit there and be polite, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I didn’t notice it. But I tell you what really interested me—and
that was watching Stella Mount and Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They were most amusing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I never noticed anything.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, my dear old man, of course you didn’t, because you
never do. But it’s perfectly plain that it’s a case between
them. I’ve thought so for a long time.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“He may be in love with her, but I’m sure she isn’t in love
with him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, she seemed to me the more obviously in love of the
two. She had all the happy, confident manner of a woman
in love.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She couldn’t be in love with him—he’s a mere boy.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very attractive to women, especially to one past her early
youth. Stella must be getting on for thirty now, and I expect
she doesn’t want to be stranded.”</p>

<p class='c015'>For some reason Peter could not bear to hear her talked of
in this way.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know she’s not in love with him,” he said doggedly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How can you know?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“By the way she looks and behaves and all that—I know how
Stella looks when she’s in love.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course you do. But since she couldn’t get you perhaps
she’d like to have Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter felt angry.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wish you wouldn’t talk like that. Stella isn’t that sort at
all—and she didn’t love me any more than I loved her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Really!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You all talk—I’ve heard Doris and Rose at it as well as you—you
all talk as if Stella had been running after me and I
wouldn’t have her. But that isn’t the truth—I loved her, and
I’d have had her like a shot if it had been possible, but it
wasn’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He felt a stiffening of Vera’s arm under his, though she did
not take it away. He realised that he had said too much. But
he couldn’t help it. There in the garden of Starvecrow, which
Stella had loved as well as he, he could not deny their common
memories&#160;... pretend that he had not loved her&#160;... he had
a ridiculous feeling that it would have been disloyal to Starvecrow
as well as to Stella.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You needn’t get so angry,” Vera was saying—“I had always
been given to understand that the affair wasn’t serious—a war-time
flirtation which peace showed up as impossible. There
were a great many like that.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“Well, this wasn’t one of them. I loved Stella as much as
she loved me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then why didn’t you marry her?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I couldn’t possibly have done so—and anyhow,” shamefacedly,
“I’m glad I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then I still say you didn’t really love her. If you had,
you’d have married her even though the family disapproved
and she hadn’t a penny. She’d have done it for you—so if you
wouldn’t do it for her, it shows that you didn’t love her as
much as she loved you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I did”—almost shouted Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>Vera took her arm away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Really, Peter, you’re in a very strange mood tonight. I
think I’ll go indoors.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m only trying to make you understand that though I
don’t love Stella now, I loved her once.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“On the contrary—you’re making me understand that though
you didn’t love her once, you love her now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How can you say that!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Because you’re giving yourself away all round. You’re
jealous of your brother, and you’re angry with me because I
don’t speak of Stella in a way you quite approve of. Don’t
worry, my dear boy. We’ve been married over a year, and I
can hardly expect your fancy never to stray. But I’d rather
you weren’t quite such a boor over it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She walked quickly into the house.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter felt as if he had been struck. He told himself that
Vera was unjust and hard and cynical. How dare she say he
was jealous of Gervase? How dare she say he had never really
loved Stella?—that was her own infernal jealousy, he supposed.
How dare she say he loved Stella now?—that again was her
infernal jealousy. He took one or two miserable turns up and
down the path, then went in to dress for dinner.</p>

<p class='c015'>A wood fire was burning sweetly in his dressing-room, and
his clothes had been laid out by the parlourmaid, who was as
good a valet as only a good parlourmaid can be. Under these
combined influences Peter learned how material comforts can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>occasionally soothe a spiritual smart, dressing there in warmth
and ease, he began to slip out of those distressing feelings
which had raged under the pergola. After all, Vera had made
him supremely happy for a year. It was ungrateful to be
angry with her now, just because she had taken it into her
head to be a little jealous. That was really a compliment to
him. Besides, now he came to think of it, he had not spoken
or behaved as he ought. What a fool he had been to kick up
such a dust just because Vera had doubted the reality of his
dead love for Stella. No wonder she had drawn conclusions&#160;... and instead of trying to soothe and reassure her, he had
only got angry.</p>

<p class='c015'>He made up his mind to apologise at once, and paused at
her door on his way downstairs. But he heard the voice of
the maid inside, and decided to wait till they were alone in
the drawing-room before dinner. She was nearly always down
a few minutes before eight.</p>

<p class='c015'>However, tonight, perversely, she did not appear. The clock
struck eight, and to Peter’s surprise, Weller, the parlourmaid,
came into the room.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dinner is served, sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But your mistress isn’t down yet.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She has ordered her dinner to be sent up to her room, Sir.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 6</h3>

<p class='c014'>Peter was not to be let off so easily as in the simplicity of
his heart he had imagined. He had transgressed the laws of
matrimony as Vera understood them, by refusing to say that
he had never really loved Stella. He ought properly to have
said that he had never really loved anyone until he met his
wife, but that, Peter told himself, was nonsense in a man of
his age. He told it to himself all the more vehemently because
he had an uneasy feeling that a year ago he would have
said what Vera wanted, that he himself would have believed
she was the only woman he had really loved.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next morning he went into her room as usual while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>she was having her breakfast, and they said the usual things
to each other as if nothing had happened. But Peter felt
awkward and ill at ease—he wanted, childishly, to “make it
up,” but did not know how to get through the invisible wall
she had built round herself. Also he knew that she would
accept nothing less than a recantation of all that he had said
yesterday—he would have to tell her that he had never loved
Stella, that all that part of his life had been dreaming and
self-deception. And he would not say it. With a queer obstinacy,
whose roots he would not examine, he refused to
deny his past, even to make the present happier and the future
more secure.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What are you doing today?” asked Vera coolly, as she
stirred her coffee.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m going over to an auction at Canterbury—they’re selling
off some old government stuff.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As a matter of fact, he had not meant to go, but now he
felt that he must do something to get himself out of the house
for the day.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then you won’t be in for lunch?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—not much before dinner, I expect.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Shall you go in the car?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Only as far as Ashford—I’ll take the train from there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It was all deadly. Going out of her room, going out of the
house, he was conscious of a deep sense of depression and
futility. Vera was displeased with him because he would not
be disloyal to the past.... After all, he supposed it was
pretty natural and most women were like that&#160;... but Vera
was different in the way she showed her displeasure—if only
she’d say things!—become angry and coaxing like other
women—like Stella when he had displeased her. He remembered
her once when she had been angry—how differently she
had behaved—with such frankness, such warmth, such
wheedling.... Vera had just turned to ice, and expressed
herself in negations and reserves. He hated that—it was all
wrong, somehow.</p>

<p class='c015'>He fretted and brooded the whole way to Ashford. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>not till he was nearly there that he remembered he had an
appointment with Godfrey at Starvecrow that afternoon.
Vera was making him not only a bad husband but a bad
farmer.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 7</h3>

<p class='c014'>Godfrey did not forget his appointment. He arrived punctually
at three o’clock, and not finding Peter at home, waited
with the patience of his kind. A further symptom of Peter’s
demoralization was his forgetting to tell anyone at Starvecrow
when he would be back, so Godfrey, who was really
anxious to have his matter settled and could scarcely believe
that anything so important to himself should seem trivial in
the stress of another’s life, felt sure that Mr. Alard would soon
come in, and having hitched his reins and assured himself
that Madge would stand for ever, went into the office and
waited.</p>

<p class='c015'>Here Jenny Alard found him at about half-past three, just
wondering whether it would be good manners for him to
smoke. She had come up to see Vera, but finding she had
gone out in the car, looked in at the office door in hopes of
finding Peter. Godfrey was sitting rather stiffly in the gate-backed
chair, turning his box of gaspers over and over in his
large brown hands. Jenny came into the room and greeted
him at once. She and her family always took pains to be
cordial to their social inferiors. If the man in the office had
been an acquaintance of her own rank, she would probably
have bowed to him, made some excuse and gone out to look
for her brother—but such behaviour would never do for anyone
who might imagine it contained a slight.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good afternoon. Are you waiting for my brother? Do
you know when he’ll be in?”</p>

<p class='c015'>He rose to greet her, and as they shook hands she realised
what a shadow his inferiority was. He stood before her six
feet high, erect, sun-burned—his thick hair and bright eyes
proclaiming his health, his good clothes proclaiming his prosperity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>a certain alert and simple air of confidence speaking of
a life free from conflict and burden.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mr. Alard made an appointment for three. But they tell
me he’s gone to Canterbury.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s a shame to keep you waiting. You’re busy, I expect.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not so terrible—and it’s the first time he’s done it. I
reckon something’s gone wrong with the car.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He hasn’t got the car—Mrs. Alard is out in it. Perhaps
he’s missed his train.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If he’s done that he won’t be here for some time, and I
can’t afford to wait much longer. I’ve a man coming to Fourhouses
about some pigs after tea.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I expect there’s a time-table somewhere—let’s look.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She rummaged among the papers at the top of the desk—auction
catalogues, advertisements for cattle foods and farm
implements—and at last drew out a local time-table. Their
heads bent over it together, and she became conscious of a
scent as of straw and clean stables coming from his clothes.
She groped among the pages not knowing her way, and then
noticed that his hands were restless as if his greater custom
were impatient of her ignorance.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—it’s page sixty-four—I remember&#160;... two pages
back&#160;... no, not there—you’ve missed it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>His hands hovered as if they longed to turn over the leaves,
but evidently he forbade them—and she guessed that he
shrank from the chance of touching hers. She looked at his
hands—they were well-shaped, except for the fingers which
work had spoiled, they were brown, strong, lean—she liked
them exceedingly. They were clean, but not as Peter’s
or Jim’s or her father’s hands were clean; they suggested
effort rather than custom—that he washed when he was
dirty in order to be clean rather than when he was clean
in order to prevent his ever being dirty.... What a
queer way her thoughts were running, and all because of
his hands—— Well, she would like to touch them&#160;... it
was funny how he held back even from such a natural contact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>as this—typical of his class, in which there was always consciousness
between the sexes&#160;... no careless, casual contacts,
no hail-fellow and hearty comradeship, but always man
and woman, some phase of courtship&#160;... romance....</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t find it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She thrust the book into his hands, and their fingers touched·
He begged her pardon—then found the page. She did not
notice what he said—her pulses were hammering. She was
excited not so much by him as by herself. Why had her whole
being lit up so suddenly?—What had set it alight? Was it
just this simple deferential consciousness of sex between them,
so much more natural than the comradeship which was the
good form of her class? Sex-consciousness was after all more
natural than sex-unconsciousness, the bridling of the flirt more
natural than the indifference of the “woman who has no
nonsense about her.” She felt a deep blush spreading over
her face—she became entirely conscious before him, uneasy
under his alert, dignified gaze.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was picking up his hat—he was saying something about
the two-forty-five being in long ago and his having no time to
wait till the four-forty.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll call in tomorrow—I’ll leave word with Elias that I’ll
call in at twelve tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m so sorry you’ve come all this way for nothing,” she
faltered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, it’s no matter. I’m not busy today. Mr. Alard must
have missed his train.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She found herself going out of the room before him. His
smart gig stood outside the door—the mare whinnied at the
sight of him. Jenny thought how good it must be to drive
horse-flesh instead of machinery.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You haven’t taken to a motor-car yet, I see.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t think I ever shall. It ud feel unfriendly.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I expect it would after this”—and she patted the
mare’s sleek neck.</p>

<p class='c015'>“A horse knows you, you see—and where you go wrong
often he’ll go right—but a car, a machine, that’s got no sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>nor kindness in it, and when you do the wrong thing there’s
nothing that’ll save you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny nodded. He warmed to his subject.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Besides, you get fond of an animal in a way you can’t of
a machine. This Madge, here. I’ve raised her from a filly,
and when I take her out of the shafts she’ll follow me round
the yard for a bit of sugar—and you heard her call to me
just now when I came out? That’s her way. You may pay
three thousand pounds for a Rolls Royce car but it won’t
never say good evening.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He laughed at his own joke, showing his big splendid teeth,
and giving Jenny an impression of sweetness and happiness
that melted into her other impressions like honey.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Did she recognise you when you came back from the war?—You
were in Mesopotamia weren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—three years. I can’t say as she properly recognised
me, but now I’ve been back a twelve-month I think she fits me
into things that happened to her before I left, if you know
what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I understand.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He had been talking to her with his foot on the step, ready
to get into his gig. Then suddenly he seemed to remember
that she did not live at Starvecrow, that she too had a journey
before her and no trap to take her home.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Can I give you a lift, Miss Alard?—I’m passing Conster.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—thank you very much,” said Jenny.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 8</h3>

<p class='c014'>That evening, sitting at dinner with her family, she felt
vaguely ashamed of herself—she had let herself go too far.
As she watched her mother’s diamond rings flashing over her
plate, as she listened to her father cynically demolishing the
Washington conference, as she contemplated Doris eating
asparagus in the gross and clumsy manner achieved only by
the well-bred, the afternoon’s adventure took discreditable
colours in her mind. What had made her feel like that towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Godfrey? Surely it was the same emotion which draws a
man towards a pretty housemaid. The young farmer was
good-looking and well-built—he had attracted her physically—and
her body had mocked at the barriers set up by her
mind, by education, birth, breeding and tradition.</p>

<p class='c015'>She wondered guiltily what Jim would think of her if he
knew. He would probably see a fresh reason for congratulating
himself on the rupture of those loose yet hampering
ties which had bound them for so long. She had never felt
like that towards Jim, though she had accepted the physical
element in their relation—thought, indeed, sometimes, that it
was unduly preponderating, holding them together when ideas
and ambitions would have drawn them apart. Was it possible
after all that Godfrey’s attraction had not been merely physical—that
there had been an allure in his simple, unaccustomed
outlook on life as well as in his splendid frame?</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase came in late to dinner, and being tired did not talk
much. After the meal was over, and Jenny was playing
bridge with her parents and Doris, he sat in the window, turning
over the pages of a book and looking out between the
curtains at the pale Spring stars. When Lady Alard’s losses
made her decide she was too tired to play any more and the
game was broken up, Jenny went over and sat beside him. It
had struck her that perhaps his life at the works, his association
with working men, might enable him to shed some
light on her problem. Not that she meant to confide in him,
but there seemed to be in Gervase now a growing sanity of
judgment; she had a new, odd respect for the experiences
of the little brother’s mind.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase,” she said—“I suppose you could never make
friends with anyone at the shop?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—I’m afraid I couldn’t. At least not with anyone
there now. But we get on all right together.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I suppose it’s the difference in education.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Partly—but chiefly the difference in our way of looking
at things.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“Surely that’s due to education.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, if by education you mean breeding—the whole life.
It’s not that we want different things, but we want them in
a different way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do all men want the same things?”</p>

<p class='c015'>He smiled.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—we all want money, women, and God.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny felt a little shocked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Some want one most, and some want another most,” continued
Gervase—“and we’re most different in our ways of
wanting money and most alike in our ways of wanting God.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How do you want money in different ways?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s not only the fact that what’s wealth to them is often
poverty to us—it’s chiefly that they get their pleasure out of
the necessities of life and we out of the luxuries. It’s never
given you any actual pleasure, I suppose, to think that you’ve
got a good house to live in and plenty to eat—but to those
chaps it’s a real happiness and I’m not talking of those who’ve
ever had to go without.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny was silent a moment. She hesitated over her next
question.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And what’s the difference in your ideas about women?”</p>

<p class='c015'>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Their talk about women makes me sick—I feel in that matter
we’ve got the pull over them. When men of our own
set get on the subject, it’s different altogether, even at its
worst. But I sometimes think that this is because their ideal
of women is really so high that they don’t look upon a certain
class of them as women at all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You think their ideal of women in general is high?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, that’s why their women are either good or bad. They
won’t stand the intervening stages the way we do. They expect
a great deal of the women they make their wives.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I suppose that a friendship between a woman of our class
and a man of theirs would be much more difficult than a friendship
between two men of different classes.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“It would be quite impossible. They don’t understand
friendship between men and women for one thing. I’m not
sure that they haven’t got too much sense.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny rose and moved away. She found the conversation
vaguely disturbing. Though, after all, she cried impatiently
to herself, why should she? They hadn’t been discussing Godfrey—only
the men where Gervase worked, who belonged altogether
to a different class. But Godfrey, yeoman farmer of
Fourhouses, solid, comfortable, respectable, able to buy land
from impoverished Alard&#160;... why should she think of him
as in a class beneath her? Her parents would think so certainly,
but that was because their ideas had grown old and
stiff with Alard’s age&#160;... mentally Alard was suffering from
arterial sclerosis&#160;... oh, for some new blood!</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 9</h3>

<p class='c014'>Peter was vexed with himself for having forgotten Godfrey’s
appointment—not that he thought his forgetfulness
would jeopardise the business between Conster and Fourhouses,
but such a lapse pointed degradingly to causes beneath
it. He had been careless and forgetful as a farmer because
he was unhappy as a husband. His private life was hurting
him and its convulsions had put his business life out of order.</p>

<p class='c015'>On his return from Canterbury there was a reconciliation
between him and Vera. His long day of futile loneliness had
broken his spirit—he could endure their estrangement no
longer, and in order to make peace was willing to stoop to
treacheries which in the morning he had held beneath his
honour. He had made Stella a burnt offering to peace. No—he
said to Vera—he had never really loved her—she had just
been “one of the others” before he met his wife.... He took
her glowing memory and put it in the prison house where
he had shut up the loves of a month and a week and a day&#160;...
he saw her in that frail company, looking at him from between
the bars, telling him that she did not belong there. But
he spoke to her roughly in his heart—“Yes you do—you’re
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>one of the thieves who stole a bit of the love I was keeping
for Vera—just that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Vera, after the first frigidities, graciously accepted his contrition.
As he was willing to acknowledge that he had never
really loved Stella, she was willing to drop the other half of
the argument and allow that he was not belatedly in love
with her now. Once more there was love and harmony at
Starvecrow—warmth in the low rooms, where the firelight
leaped on creamy walls and the rustle of Vera’s silk seemed
to live like an echo, a voluptuous ghost. The cold, thin Spring
seemed shut outside the house—the interior of Starvecrow,
its ceilings, doors, walls and furniture meant more to Peter
now than its barns and stacks and cobbled yard, even than its
free woods and fields.</p>

<p class='c015'>The cold, thin Spring warmed and thickened in the woods.
The floods receded from the Tillingham marshes, and the
river ran through a golden street of buttercups to the sea.
The winter sowings put a bloom of vivid green into the
wheat fields, the blossom of apple, cherry, pear and plum
drifted from the boughs of the orchard to the grass, leaving
the first green hardness of the fruits among the leaves; and
as the outer world grew warm and living, once more the heart
of the house grew cold. Peter and Vera were not estranged,
but the warm dusk of their rapture had given place to the
usual daylight, in which Peter saw the ugly things his peace
contained.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was not blinded by the wonder that had happened, by
the knowledge that probably, almost certainly, Vera was to
have a child—that there would be an heir to Conster and
Alard, and lovely Starvecrow would not go to strangers. He
felt intensely relieved that his fears would not be realised,
that he was not inevitably building for Gervase to throw down—but
there was less glamour about the event than he had anticipated,
it could not set his heart at rest, nor make Vera
shine with all the old light of the honeymoon.</p>

<p class='c015'>He had always thought and heard that expecting a child
brings husband and wife even closer together than the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>days of love—he was vexed that the charm did not work.
Was it because of his feeling that if the child were a girl
it might just as well not be born? That was certainly the
wrong thing to feel, for much as he longed for an heir, he
should not forget that a girl would be his child, the child of
the woman he loved. Then one day he had a dreadful realisation—the
conviction that if he were waiting for Stella’s
child it would all have been different, that he would have
thought of the child as much as now he thought of the heir.
Of course he would still have wanted an heir, but he would
not have had the feeling that if it did not give him a boy
his wife’s childbearing was in vain.... In vain—in vain....
He would not have known that word which now he
found in his mind so often—“Marriage in vain if there is no
child&#160;... childbearing in vain if there is no heir.” He saw
his marriage as a mere tool of Alard’s use, a prop to that
sinking edifice of the Squires.... He felt as miserable as
in the first days of the cold, thin Spring.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 10</h3>

<p class='c014'>He now no longer denied that in one sense he had made a
mistake in marrying Vera. He still found her brilliant and
beautiful, a charming if sometimes a too sophisticated companion.
But she was not the wife of his heart and imagination.
Her personality stood queerly detached from the rest
of his life—apart from his ideas of home and family. He
felt coldly angry with her for the ways in which she refused
or failed to fulfil his yearnings, and he could never, he felt,
quite forgive her for having demanded Stella as a sacrifice.
His denial of his love for Stella, which he had made in the
interests of peace, now pierced his memory like a thorn—partly
he reproached himself, and partly he reproached Vera.
And there was a reproach for Stella too.</p>

<p class='c015'>But he still told himself that he was glad he had married
Vera. After all, he had got what he wanted. All he no
longer had was the illusion that had fed him for a year after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>marriage, the illusion that in taking Vera he had done the
best thing for himself as a man as well as an Alard. He
could no longer tell himself that Vera was a better wife and
a sweeter woman than he would have found Stella—that even
without family considerations he had still made the happiest
choice. That dream had played its part, and now might well
die, and yet leave him with the thought that he had chosen
well.</p>

<p class='c015'>He need not look upon his marriage as mercenary because
it was practical rather than romantic, nor himself as a fool
because he had been heated and dizzied into taking a step
he could never have taken in cold blood. He had always
planned to marry money for the sake of Alard and Starvecrow,
and he could never have done so without the illusion
of love. Nature had merely helped him carry out what he
had unnaturally planned.... And Starvecrow was safe,
established—and under his careful stewardship the huge,
staggering Conster estate would one day recover steadiness.
The interest on the mortgages was always punctually paid,
and he had hopes of being able in a year or two to pay off
some of the mortgages themselves. By the time he became
Sir Peter Alard he might be in a fair way of clearing the property....
So why regret the romance he had never chosen?</p>

<p class='c015'>He told himself he would regret nothing if he was sure that
Stella would not marry Gervase—that having very properly
shut romance out of his own house, he should not have to
see it come next door. In his clearer moments he realised
that this attitude was unreasonable, or that, if reasonable, it
pointed to an unhealthy state of affairs, but he could never
quite bully or persuade himself out of it. He had to confess
that it would be intolerable to have to welcome as a
sister the woman he had denied himself as a wife. Anything,
even total estrangement, would be better than that—better than
having to watch her making his brother’s home the free and
happy place she might have made his own, throwing her
sweetness and her courage into the risks of his brother’s life,
bearing his brother’s children, made after all the mother of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Alards&#160;... perhaps the mother of Alard’s heir. This last
thought tormented him most. He saw a preposterous genealogical
table:</p>

<div class='mono'>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line in30'>John  Peter   George   Gervase</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>From the family’s decaying trunk he saw a new healthy
branch springing through the grafting in of Stella’s life—healthy
but alien, for the children Stella gave Gervase would
not be Alards in the true sense of the children she might have
given Peter. They would be soaked in their father’s disloyal
ideas. His bad sense, his bad form. John, Peter, George and
Gervase would probably smash up what was left of the tradition
and the estate.... Peter saw them selling Starvecrow,
selling Conster, opening shops and works, marrying indiscriminately....
He hated these insurgent nephews his mind had
begotten.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now and then he told himself that his fears were ill-founded.
If Stella was going to marry Gervase surely something
definite would be known about it by this time. She was
not so young that she could afford to wait indefinitely. But
against this he knew that Gervase was scarcely twenty-one,
and that neither of them had a penny. A long, public engagement
would be difficult for many reasons. There might be
some secret understanding. His brother still spent most of his
Sundays at Vinehall... better not deceive himself with the
idea that he went merely for devotional reasons, to gratify
this newly-formed taste which to Peter smacked as unseemly
as an appetite. No, he went to see Stella, sit with her, talk
with her&#160;... kiss her, hold her on his knee, feel the softness
of her hair between his fingers&#160;... oh damn!—if only he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>knew definitely one way or the other, he could choke down
his imagination.... His imagination was making a hopeless
fool of him with its strokings and its kisses—with its John,
Peter, George and Gervase....</p>

<p class='c015'>His uneasiness finally drove him to take what a little earlier
would have seemed an impossible way out of his difficulties.
One day, at the end of the brooding of a lonely walk, he
met Stella unexpectedly in Icklesham street, and after the
inevitable platitudes of greeting followed the first wild plunges
of his mind.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I say, Stella—forgive my asking you—but am I to congratulate
you and Gervase?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The colour rushed over her face, and he had an uneasy
moment, wondering whether he had guessed right or merely
been impertinent.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—you’ll never have to do that,” she answered firmly
the next minute.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I—I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He was flushing too, partly with relief, partly with apprehension
at the rejoiced, violent beating of his heart.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, it doesn’t matter a bit. Other members of your family
have been half-asking—hinting&#160;... so I’d rather you asked
outright. Of course, seeing that I’m seven years older than
Gervase, one would have thought&#160;... but I suppose people
must have something to talk about.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He assented weakly—and it suddenly struck him that she
was wondering why he had asked her instead of Gervase.</p>

<p class='c015'>“As a matter of fact,” she continued, “I don’t see so much
of him as people think. He comes over to us on Sundays, but
that’s partly for Father Luce. He serves the Parish Mass,
and they both have lunch with us afterwards—and in the
afternoon he helps with the children.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter felt inexpressibly relieved that there was no truth
in his picture of Gervase and Stella in the afternoon—no
kisses, no strokings of her hair, which was like fine silk between
your fingers&#160;... like a child’s hair.... Fresh and
bright and living as ever, it curled up under the brim of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>hat&#160;... he wondered if she saw how he was staring at it—yes,
she must, for she put up her hand rather nervously and
pushed a curl under the straw.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Please contradict anything you hear said about him and
me,” she said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I promise I will. It was Vera put it into my head.
She said she was quite sure Gervase was in love with you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, please contradict it—it will be annoying for Gervase
as well as for me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A sudden fear seized Peter—a new fear—much more unreasonable
and selfish than the old one. It expressed itself
with the same suddenness as it came, and before he could
check himself he had said—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella&#160;... there isn’t&#160;... there isn’t anyone else?”</p>

<p class='c015'>He knew that moment that he had given himself away, and
he could not find comfort in any thought of her not having
noticed. For a few seconds she stared at him silently with
her bright perplexed eyes. Then she said—</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, there isn’t.... But, Peter, why shouldn’t there be?”</p>

<p class='c015'>He murmured something silly and surly—he was annoyed
with her for not tactfully turning the conversation and covering
his blunder.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m nearly twenty-eight,” she continued—“and if I can
manage to fall in love, I shall marry.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, don’t wait for that,” he said, still angry—“you can
marry perfectly well without it. I have, and it’s been most
successful.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He knew that he had hurt her in the soft places of her
heart; and with his knowledge a fire kindled, setting strange
hot cruelties ablaze.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Besides, it’s easy enough to fall in love, you know—I’ve
done it lots of times, and so have you, I expect—easy enough
to fall in love and just as easy to fall out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She answered him sweetly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I can do both—I’ve done both—but it’s not been easy,
not a bit.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’ll wish you luck.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>He took off his hat and passed on. For a quarter of a mile
he hated her. He hated her because he had wounded her,
and because she would not be proud enough to hide the wound—because
from outside his life she still troubled it—because
he had lied to her—because he had treated her badly—because
he had once loved her and because he had denied it—because
he loved her still and could not deny it any more.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 11</h3>

<p class='c014'>He was so busy hating and loving her that he did not notice
the large car that passed him at the cross roads till he heard
it slithering to a stop. Then he looked up and saw it was
his mother’s. Jenny stuck her head out of the window.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hullo, Peter! Like a lift home?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No thanks, I’m not going home. I’ve got to call at Fourhouses.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Haven’t you finished that dreadful business yet?” asked
Lady Alard in a tragic voice. The selling of thirty acres to
the farm which had originally owned them struck her as the
deepest humiliation the family had had yet to swallow.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—the agreement’s been signed, but there’s a few minor
matters cropped up over the transfer.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why don’t you make him come and see you? Why should
you walk six miles across country to interview a man like
Godfrey?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Because I wanted a walk,” said Peter shortly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ve got terribly restless lately. This is the second time
I’ve met you tramping about like a—like a——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I call it very sensible of him,” said Jenny—“we’re a lazy
lot—rolling about in cars. I’ve half a mind to get down and
walk with him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But he’s going to Fourhouses, dear.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Never mind—I’d like to see Fourhouses.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your shoes are too thin for walking.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not on a day like this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter opened the door—he was anxious for Jenny’s company,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>she would take his thoughts off recent complications. He
helped her out, and signed to Appleby to drive on.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ve been paying calls in Winchelsea,” said Jenny with
a grimace—“Oh, Peter, this is a dog’s life.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter would not have liked himself to spend an afternoon
paying calls, but he regarded it as part of a woman’s duty,
and rather disapproved of Jenny’s rebellion. He liked her,
and admired her for her young well-bred loveliness, but lately
he had begun to think she was getting too like Gervase....</p>

<p class='c015'>“Somebody must pay calls,” he said a little gruffly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?” asked Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t be silly, my dear. You know it’s a social necessity.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, it oughtn’t to be—just knowing a lot of dull people
because they live in the same neighbourhood and are of the
same social standing as ourselves—keeping up our intercourse
by means of perfunctory visits which we hate paying as much
as they hate receiving&#160;... carefully dodging the tea-hour,
so that there’ll be no chance of any real hospitality...”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So that’s how you choose to describe it——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s how it is.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter said nothing. He told himself emphatically that
Stella probably had exactly the same ideas. Now Vera, for
all her intellect and modernity, never shirked her social obligations.
Oh, he had done right, after all.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny was enjoying the walk, in spite of her thin shoes
and the gruffness of her companion—in spite of some feelings
of trepidation at her own recklessness. She was going to see
Godfrey again after an interval of nearly two months&#160;...
she was going to see him through her own deliberate choice
and contrivance. Directly Peter had mentioned Fourhouses
she had made up her mind to go with him. If Godfrey’s attraction
had not been merely good health and good looks,
but his character, his circumstances, she would know more
of her own feelings when she saw him in his proper setting,
against the background of Fourhouses. His background at
present was her own revolt against the conditions of her life—for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>two months she had seen him standing like a symbolic
figure of emancipation among the conventions, restrictions
and sacrifices which her position demanded. Life had been
very hard for her during those months, or perhaps not so hard
as heavy. She had missed the habit of her relation to Jim
Parish and felt the humiliation of its breaking off—the humiliation
of meeting him casually as he dangled after an heiress....
“He’ll do like Peter—he’ll make himself fall in love with
a girl with money and live happy ever afterwards.” She
had felt the galling pettiness of the social round, the hollowness
of the disguises which her family had adopted, the falseness
of the standards which they had set up. “We must at
all costs have as many acres of land as we can keep together—we
must have our car and our menservants—our position
as a ‘county family.’ We call ourselves the New Poor, though
we have all these. But we’re not lying, because in order to
keep them we’ve given up all the really good things of life—comfort
and tranquillity and freedom and love. So we’re Poor
indeed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She was frankly curious to see the home of the man whose
values were not upside down, who had not sacrificed essentials
to appearances, who found his pleasure in common things, who,
poorer than the poverty of Alard, yet called himself rich.
Godfrey had captured her imagination, first no doubt through
his virile attraction, but maintaining his hold through the
contrast of her brief glimpse of him with the life that was
daily disappointing her. She asked Peter one or two questions
about Fourhouses. It ran to about four hundred acres,
mostly pasture. Godfrey grew wheat, as well as conservatively
maintaining his hop-gardens, but the strength of the
farm was in livestock. His father had died twelve years ago,
leaving the place in surprisingly good condition for those days
of rampant free trade—he had a mother and two sisters living
with him, Peter believed. Yes, he had always liked Godfrey,
a sober, steady, practical fellow, who had done well for himself
and his farm.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ 12</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Fourhouses showed plainly the origin of its name. The
original dwelling-house was a sturdy, square structure to
which some far-back yeoman had added a gabled wing. An
inheritor had added another wing, and a third had incorporated
one of the barns—the result was many sprawling inequalities
of roof and wall. No one seemed to have thought about the
building as a whole, intent only on his own improvements,
so that the very materials as well as the style of its construction
were diverse—brick, tile, stone, timber—Tudor austerity,
Elizabethan ornament, Georgian convention.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was no one about in the yard, so Peter walked up to
the front door and rang the bell. It was answered by a pretty,
shy young woman whose pleasant gown was covered by an
apron.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good afternoon, Miss Godfrey. Is your brother in?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, Mr. Alard. If you’ll step into the parlour I’ll tell
him you’re here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny glanced at Peter, asking silently for an introduction.
But her brother seemed abstracted, and forgot the courtesy
he had practised at Starvecrow.</p>

<p class='c015'>The young woman ushered them into a little stuffy room
beside the door. There was a table in the middle of it covered
by a thick velvet cloth, in the midst of which some musky
plant was enthroned in a painted pot. There were more plants
in the window, their leaves obscuring the daylight, which
came through them like green water oozing through reeds.
Jenny felt a pang of disappointment—this little room which
was evidently considered the household’s best showed her
with a sharp check the essential difference between Alard and
Godfrey. Here was a worse difference than between rough
and smooth, coarse and delicate, vulgar and refined—it was
all the difference between good taste and bad taste. Ben Godfrey’s
best clothes would be like this parlour—he would look
far more remote from her in them than he looked in his broadcloth
and gaiters.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Fortunately he was not wearing his best clothes when he
came in a few minutes later. He came stooping under the
low door, all the haymaking’s brown on his face since their
last meeting.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, this is good of you, Mr. Alard, coming all this way.
Why didn’t you send me a line to call around at Starvecrow?
Good evening, Miss Alard—have you walked all the way from
Conster too?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh no, I drove as far as Icklesham. The car’s making
me lazy.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, you’ve had a good walk anyway. Won’t you come
in and have a cup of tea? We’re just sitting down to it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It was six o’clock and neither Peter nor Jenny had remembered
that there were human beings who took tea at this hour.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thank you so much,” said Jenny—“I’ll be glad.” She
had had her tea at Conster before leaving to pay the calls, but
she said to herself “If I go in now and see them all having six
o’clock tea together, it’ll finish it.” Since she had seen the
parlour she had thought it would be a good job if she finished
it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Godfrey led the way down a flagged passage into the oldest
part of the house. The room where his family were having
tea had evidently once been a kitchen, but was now no longer
used as such, though the fireplace and cupboards remained.
The floor was covered with brick, and the walls bulged in and
out of huge beams, evidently ship’s timber and riddled with
the salt that had once caked them. Similar beams lay across
the ceiling and curved into the wall, showing their origin in
a ship’s ribs—some Tudor seafarer had settled down ashore
and built his ship into his house. Long casement windows
let in the fullness of the evening sun, raking over the fields
from Snowden in the west—its light spilled on the cloth,
on the blue and white cups, on the loaf and the black teapot,
on the pleasant faces and broad backs of the women sitting
round.</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is my mother—Miss Alard; and my sister Jane, and
my sister Lily....” He performed his introductions shyly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>The women stood up and shook hands—Jane Godfrey found
a chair for Jenny, and Mrs. Godfrey poured her out a cup
of very strong tea. There was a moment’s constraint and
some remarks about the weather but soon an easier atmosphere
prevailed. This was partly due to Peter, who was always at
his best with those who were not socially his equals. Jenny
had often noticed how charming and friendly he was with
his father’s tenants and the village people, whereas with his
own class he was often gruff and inarticulate. She knew
that this was not due to any democratic tastes, but simply to
the special effort which his code and tradition demanded of
him on such occasions. She had never realised so plainly the
advantages of birth and breeding, as when at such times she
saw her unsociable brother exert himself, not to patronage but
to perfect ease.</p>

<p class='c015'>She herself found very little to say—she was too busy observing
her surroundings. The “best parlour” atmosphere
had entirely vanished—the contrast which the kitchen at Fourhouses
presented with the drawing-room at Conster was all
in the former’s favour. She found a comfort, dignity and ease
which were absent from the Alard ceremonial of afternoon
tea, in spite of Wills and the Sèvres china. Whether it was
the free spill of the sunshine on table and floor, the solid,
simple look of the furniture, the wonder of the old ship’s
beams, or the sweet unhurried manners of the company, she
could not say, but the whole effect was safe and soothing—there
was an air of quiet enjoyment, of emphasis on the fact
that a good meal eaten in good company was a source of
pleasure and congratulation to all concerned.</p>

<p class='c015'>She ate a substantial tea of bread and butter and lettuce,
listening while Peter and Ben Godfrey talked post-war politics,
now and then responding to a shy word from one of the
Godfrey women. She was reluctant to praise what she saw
around her, to comment on the charm and dignity of the house,
for fear she should seem to patronize—but a remark ventured
on its age found Mrs. Godfrey eager to talk of her home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and able to tell much of its history. After tea she offered
to show Jenny the upstairs rooms.</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is a fine old house, I’ve been told. The other day a
gentleman came over from Rye on purpose to see it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They walked up and down a number of small twisting
passages, broken with steps and wanting light. Rooms led
inconveniently out of one another—windows were high under
the ceiling or plumb with the floor. There was a great deal of
what was really good and lovely—old timber-work, old cupboards,
a fine dresser, a gate-legged table and a couple of tallboys—and
a great deal that recalled the best parlour, the iron
bedsteads, marble-topped washstands, flower-painted mirrors
and garlanded wall-paper of the new rural tradition. All, however,
was good of its kind, comfortable and in sound repair.
Mrs. Godfrey was proud of it all equally.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I suppose, Miss Alard, you don’t find it much of a
house compared to your own.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think it’s lovely,” said Jenny—“much more exciting than
Conster.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Godfrey was not sure whether a house had any right
to be exciting, so she made no reply. They went downstairs
again, and fearing the best parlour, Jenny suggested that they
should go out into the yard and find the men.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They must have finished their business by now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’ll be in Ben’s office—leastways in what he calls his
office,” said Mrs. Godfrey with a small tolerant laugh.</p>

<p class='c015'>She led the way into one of the barns where a corner was
boarded off into a little room. Here stood a second-hand roll-topped
desk and a really good yew-backed chair. The walls
were covered with scale-maps of the district and advertisements
for cattle food, very much after the style of the office
at Starvecrow. Jenny looked round for some individual mark
of Ben, but saw none, unless the straightness and order of
it all were an index to his character.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’ll be showing Mr. Alard the stock—he’s proud of his
stock,” said Mrs. Godfrey, and sure enough the next minute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>they heard voices in the yard, and saw Godfrey and Peter
coming out of the cow-shed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here you are,” cried Peter to his sister—“I want you to
look at Mr. Godfrey’s Sussex cattle. He’s got the finest I’ve
seen in the district.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny could not speak for a moment. She had seen a look
in Godfrey’s eyes when they fell on her that deprived her of
speech. Her heart was violently turned to the man from his
surroundings in which she had sought a refuge for her self-respect—Fourhouses,
its beauties and its uglinesses, became
dim, and she saw only what she had seen at first and been
ashamed of—the man whom she could—whom she must—love.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 13</h3>

<p class='c014'>Having tea at Fourhouses had not “finished it”; and she
was glad, in spite of the best parlour. The Godfreys’ life
might be wofully lacking in ornament, but she had seen
enough to know that it was sound in fundamentals. Here
was the house built on a rock, lacking style perhaps, but standing
firm against the storms—while Alard was the house built
on the sand, the sand of a crumbled and obsolete tradition,
still lovely as it faced the lightning with its towers, but with
its whole structure shaken by the world’s unrest.</p>

<p class='c015'>She did not take in many impressions of her last few minutes
at the farm. The outhouses and stables, tools and stock,
were only a part of this bewildered turning of herself. They
scarcely seemed outside her, but merged into the chaotic
thought processes which her mind was slowly shaking into
order. A quarter of an hour later she found herself walking
with Peter along the road that winds at the back of Icklesham
mill....</p>

<p class='c015'>“Uncommon good sort of people, those Godfreys,” her
brother was saying.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I liked them very much.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think there’s no class in England to equal the old-fashioned
yeoman farmer. I’d be sorry to see him die out.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“Do you think he will die out?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well—land is always getting more and more of a problem.
There aren’t many who can keep things up as well as Godfrey.
He’s had the sense to go for livestock—it’s the only
thing that pays nowadays. Of course the farmers are better
off than we are—they aren’t hit the same way by taxation.
But rates are high, and labour’s dear and damn bad. I really
don’t know what’s going to become of the land, but I think
the yeoman will last longer than the Squire. Government supports
him, and won’t do a thing for us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny said nothing. She felt unequal to a discussion in
her present mood.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I envy Godfrey in a lot of ways,” continued Peter—“he’s
been able to do for his place things that would save ours if
only we could afford them. He’s broken fifteen acres of
marsh by the Brede River and gets nine bushels to the acre.
Then you saw his cattle.... Something to be proud of there.
If we could only go in for cattle-breeding on a large scale we
might get the farms to pay.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I like the way they live,” said Jenny—“they seem so quiet
and solid—so—so without a struggle.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Godfrey must be pretty well off, I suppose. I don’t
know how he’s made his money—I expect his father did it
for him. But he paid us cash down for the land, and doesn’t
seem to feel it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t suppose they’re better off than we are. It’s simply
that they aren’t in the mess we’re in—and they haven’t got
to keep up appearances. They’re free, so they’re contented.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter evidently suspected a fling at Alard in this speech, for
he answered gravely.</p>

<p class='c015'>“All the same, it’s up to us to stand by our own class. I
daresay the Godfreys are happier and more comfortable than
we are, but we can’t ever be like them. We can’t shelve our
responsibilities. We’ve got a tradition as old as theirs, and
we have to stick to it, even if at present it seems to be going
under. Personally I’m proud of it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Again Jenny felt herself unable to argue, to tell Peter, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Gervase would have done, that what he called responsibilities
were only encumbrances, that what he called tradition was only
a false standard. Instead she was acutely conscious of her
disloyalty to her people’s cause, of how near she stood to
betraying it.</p>

<p class='c015'>She had not quite realised this before, she had not grasped
the full implications of the inward movements of her heart.
She had seen herself first, in bitter shame, as a young woman
whose sexual consciousness had been stirred by a young man
of a lower class; then she had seen herself as enticed not
merely by his health and comeliness but by his happy independence,
his freedom from the shackles that bound her—till
at last he had become a symbol of the life outside the Alard
tradition, of the open country beyond the Alard estate, a contrast
to all that was petty, arbitrary and artificial in her surroundings.
And now, this evening, at Fourhouses, she had
met the man again, and met him without shame. She knew
now that she was attracted to him not merely in spite of his
class but because of it—because he belonged to the honourable
class of the land’s freemen. He appealed to her as a man,
speaking to her with his eyes the language that is common
to all men, and he appealed to her as a freeman, because she
knew that if she went to him she would be free—free of all
the numberless restrictions and distresses that bound her youth.</p>

<p class='c015'>The problem before her now was not whether she should be
ashamed or not ashamed of his attraction, but whether she
should yield to it or turn away. She faced these new thoughts
during the rest of her walk with Peter, between the dry, abstracted
phrases of her conversation—during dinner and the
long dreary evening of cards and desultory talk—and at last,
in greater peace, when she had gone to bed and lay watching
the grey moonlight that moved among the trees of the plantation.</p>

<p class='c015'>What was she to do? What had she done? Had she fallen
in love with Godfrey? Was she going to tear her life out of
its groove and merge it with his, just on the strength of those
three meetings? She did not know—she was not sure. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>could not be in love yet, but she felt sure that she was going
to be. At least so she should have said if he had been a man
of her own class. Then why should she act any differently
because he was not? Her defiance grew. Godfrey’s class was
a good class—his family was old, substantial and respected.
It was silly and snobbish to talk as if he belonged to some
menial order—though, hang it all, any order was better than
the order of impoverished country families to which she belonged.</p>

<p class='c015'>Resentfully Jenny surveyed her tribe. She saw the great
families of the Kent and Sussex borders struggling to show
the world the same front that they had shown before they
were shaken. She saw them failing in that struggle one by
one—here a great house was closed, and for sale, with no
buyers because of its unwieldy vastness and long disrepair—here
another was shorn of its estate stripped off it in building
plots and small holdings—yet another had lost its freedom
in mortgages, and kept its acres only at the price of
being bound to their ruin. There was no need for Gervase to
tell that the Squires, having outlived their day, were going
under—her broken romance with Jim Parish had shown her
that. She had realised then that it was not likely that she
would ever marry into her own class. The young men who
were her friends and associates in the life of the county must
marry wealth. Peter had gone outside the county and married
money—she too one day would have to go outside and
marry money—or marry where money did not matter. The
days were gone when Manor mated with Manor and Grange
with Grange—mighty alliances like the marriages of Kings.
Nowadays, just as Kings could no longer mate with the blood
royal but sought consorts among their subjects, so the Squires
must seek their wives outside the strict circle of the “county”—and
not even in the professional classes, which were nearly
as hard-hit as themselves, but in the classes of aspiring trade,
nouveaux-riches, war-profiteers....</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny grimaced—yet, after all, what else was there to do?
Remain a spinster like Doris, or induce some hot-blooded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>heir of impoverished acres to forget them in a moment of romance,
from which he would wake one day to reproach her....
No, she would have to be like the rest and marry outside
the tribe. But since she must go out, why shouldn’t she
go out in the direction she chose? Why was it very right and
proper to marry into trade as long as it is wealthy, and somehow
all wrong if it is not? Why was Peter without reproach
for marrying Vera Asher, whose grandfather had kept a
clothes-mart in the city, while she would never be forgiven
if she married Ben Godfrey, whose grandfather, with his
father and fathers before him, had been a yeoman farmer of
ancient land?</p>

<p class='c015'>The answer of course was plain, and she must not be cynical
in giving it. If she acknowledged that the excuse was money
she must also acknowledge that it was money for the family’s
sake—money to keep the family alive, to save its estates from
dispersal and its roof from strangers. These men and women
married into a class beneath them to save their families. But
if they did so to save their families, why shouldn’t she do so
to save herself? Why was there always this talk of the group,
the tribe, the clan, while the individual was sacrificed and
pushed under? Both she and Jim Parish had been sacrificed
to his family.... Doris had been sacrificed to hers&#160;... and
there was Mary, sacrificed to the family’s good name, escaping,
it is true, at the last, but not till after her wings had been
broken&#160;... there was Peter, marrying a rich woman and becoming
dull and stuffy and precise in consequence. Only
Gervase so far had not been sacrificed—probably he would
never be, for he had already chosen his escape. And she—she
now had her chance&#160;... but she did not know if she
would take it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Lying there in the white break of the dawn, her mind strung
with sleeplessness, she faced the danger. If she did not
escape Alard would have her—she would have to offer herself
to it either as Doris had offered herself or as Peter had
offered himself.... Why should she? Why should she sacrifice
her youth to prop its age—an age which must inevitably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>end in death. “Things can’t go on much longer—it’s only a
question of putting off the end.” If the house was bound to
fall, why should she be buried in the ruins?... She had a
momentary pang—for she knew that Peter had great schemes
for Alard, great dreams for it—that he hoped to save it and
give it back, even in the midst of the world’s shaking, some of
its former greatness. But she could not help that. For Peter
the family might be the biggest thing in life—for her it was not,
and she would be betraying the best of herself if she did not
put it second to other things. What she wanted most in the
world was love—love, peace, settlement, the beauty of content&#160;... these no one but Ben Godfrey could give her.</p>

<p class='c015'>The sky was faintly pink behind the firs. A single bird’s
note dropped into the still air. She heard a movement in the
room next to hers—she and Gervase still slept at the top of
the house in the two little rooms they had had as girl and boy.
Her brother was getting up—first, she knew, to serve the altar
at Vinehall, then to drive away over the Kentish hills to his
work among bolts and screws and nuts and rods and grease&#160;... there is more than one way out of the City of Destruction.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 14</h3>

<p class='c014'>After that she must have slept, for when she next opened
her eyes she had made up her mind. Jenny was not naturally
irresolute but she was diffident, and this problem of escape
was the biggest she had ever had to tackle. However, sleep
had straightened out the twisted workings of her thought—the
way was clear at last.</p>

<p class='c015'>She sprang out of bed, alive with a glowing sense of determination.
She knew that she had a great deal to plan
and to do. This love affair, apart from its significance, was
entirely different from any other she had had. Her intuition
told her that she would have to make the openings, carry on
all the initial stages of the wooing. She would have to show
Godfrey that she cared, or his modesty would make him hang
back. In common language she would have to “make the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>running.” Rather to her surprise, she found that she enjoyed
the prospect. She remembered once being a little shocked
by Stella Mount, who had confided that she liked making love
herself just as much as being made love to.... Well, Jenny
was not exactly going to make love, but she was going to do
something just as forward, just as far from the code of well-bred
people—she was going to show a man in a class beneath
her that she cared for him, that she wanted his admiration, his
courtship....</p>

<p class='c015'>She hurried over her bath and dressing, urged by the conviction
that she must act, take irretraceable steps, before she
had time to think again. She had already thought enough—more
thought would only muddle her, wrap her in clouds. Action
would make things clearer than any amount of reflection.
She would go over to Fourhouses—a litter of collie pups she
had confusedly admired the day before would give her an
excuse for a visit, an excuse which would yet be frail enough to
show that it alone had not brought her there.</p>

<p class='c015'>She was the first at breakfast that morning, and hoped that
no one else would come down while she was in the room. Her
father was generally the earliest, but today she did not hear
his footstep till she was leaving the table. There were two
doors out of the breakfast-room, and Jenny vanished guiltily
through one as Sir John came in at the other. She was
ashamed of herself for such Palais Royal tactics, but felt she
would stoop to them rather than risk having her resolution
scotched by the sight of her father.</p>

<p class='c015'>She had decided to go on foot to Fourhouses—not only
would it mean a more unobtrusive departure from Conster,
but it would show Godfrey her determination. The purchase
of a puppy she had scarcely noticed the day before was a
flimsy excuse for walking five miles across country the first
thing next morning. He would be bound to see at least part
of its significance—and she had known and appraised enough
men to realise that his was the warm, ready type which does
not have to see the whole road clear before it advances.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>The early day was warm; a thick haze clotted the air, which
was full of the scents of grass and dust, of the meadowsweet
and the drying hay. The little lanes were already stuffy with
sunshine, and before Jenny had come to Brede she realised that
the light tweed suit she had put on was too heavy, and her
summer-felt hat was making a band of moisture round her
head, so that her hair lay draggled on her brows. She took off
her coat and slung it over her arm&#160;... phew! how airless this
part of the country was, with its old, old lanes, trodden by a
hundred generations of hobnails to the depth of fosses&#160;...
when she was across the marsh with its trickery of dykes she
would leave the road and take to the fields. The way had not
seemed so long yesterday in the cool of the evening.... What
would Peter say if he could see her now?—Poor old Peter!
It would be dreadful for him if she carried out her scheme.
He felt about things more strongly than anyone.... She was
sorry for Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then she wondered what Godfrey would think when he
saw her, arriving hot and tired and breathless, with her trumped
up excuse for seeing him again. Would he despise her?—Perhaps,
after all, he did not particularly care about her—she
was a fool to be so sure that he did. He probably had that
slow, admiring way with all women. Besides, it’s ridiculous to
go by the look in a man’s eyes&#160;... silly&#160;... schoolgirlish&#160;... novel-reading-old-maidish&#160;... she was losing her balance
in her hatred of things. She would probably find out that he
was in love with some girl of his own class.... Her heart
beat painfully at such an idea and her ridiculous mind denied
it, but she knew that her mind was only obeying her heart.</p>

<p class='c015'>...&#160;Or he might fail to see anything significant in her
coming. He probably had one of those slow-moving country
brains on which everything is lost but the direct hit. He most
likely was a dull dog&#160;... and she had thought he could make
her happy—Jenny Alard, with her quick mind, high breeding
and specialised education. Her longing to escape had driven
her into fancying herself in love. All she wanted was to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>away from home—and this door stood open. Beyond it she
might find even worse restrictions and futilities than those from
which she fled.</p>

<p class='c015'>She was losing heart, and almost lost purpose as well. She
stopped in the lane at the foot of Snailham hill, and looked
back towards the north. Conster was hidden behind the ridge
of Udimore but she was still on Alard ground—there was
Crouch’s Farm beside the Brede River—and Little Float and
Cockmartin, both Alard farms—and all that green width of
marsh was Alard’s, with its dotted sheep. She had a preposterous
feeling that if she walked off the estate on to Godfrey’s
land it would be too late to turn back&#160;... if she was
going back she must go back now.</p>

<p class='c015'>She stood in the pebbly marle, looking over the marsh to the
trees where Udimore church showed a hummock of roof. She
tried to examine herself, to find out in a few giddy seconds
why she was going to Fourhouses. Was it simply because she
was tired of convention—of county shams—of having to go
without things she wanted in order to have things she didn’t
want?—or was she in love with Ben Godfrey, and going to
him in spite of the efforts of her class instinct to keep her back?
She suddenly knew that the latter was the only good reason.
If it was true that she had fallen in love with Godfrey the
second time she had seen him—that afternoon, weeks back, at
Starvecrow—and if all this hatred of Alard ways, this ramp
against convention, was no genuine revolt against either but
just the effort of her mind to justify her heart—then she had
better go forward. But if, on the other hand, she really hated
her life and was willing to take any way of escape—particularly
if her unrest was due to the collapse of her affair with
Jim Parish—if she was going to Fourhouses only to escape
from Conster—then she had better turn back.</p>

<p class='c015'>She stood for a moment hesitating, her heels deep in the silt
of the lane, her eyes strained towards Udimore. Then a footstep
made her start and turn round. She had the confused
impression of a man and a gun, of a recognition and a greeting,
all blurred together in the mists of her surprise. She had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>expected to meet him so far from his farm, right off his own
land&#160;... she felt a quake of disappointment, too; for the
boundaries of the two estates had now a mysterious significance,
and she was sorry that she had met him before she had
left Alard ground, before she had escaped.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good morning, Miss Alard. You’ve come a long way so
early.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes; I was coming to Fourhouses—it struck me that you
might be willing to sell one of those collie pups you showed me
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This was not how she had meant to speak. She knew her
voice was clipped and cold. Hang it! she might have managed
to break through the wall on this special occasion. First
words are the most significant, and she had meant hers to have
a more than ordinary warmth, instead of which they had a
more than ordinary stiffness. But it was no good trying—she
would never be able so to get rid of the traditions of her class
and of her sex as to show this young man that she loved him&#160;... if indeed she really did love him.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was speaking now—she forced herself to listen to what
he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d never sell you one of those—they’re not worth paying
for. It’s only I’m that soft-hearted I couldn’t think of drowning
them. I got rid of the last litter quite easily, just giving
them away. So I’ll be grateful if you’ll accept one.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thank you—but I really couldn’t allow—I mean....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Won’t you come up to the place and look at them? You’ll
see for yourself they’re not much. I could let you have a
really good retriever-pup later, but these collies—it’s just my
sister’s Lizzie that one of our old men gave her years ago, and
she’s no particular breed, and the sire’s their dog at Wickham.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thanks ever so much—but you’re out with your gun, so I
won’t trouble you to turn back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She wondered if he would make any explanation, offer some
apology for carrying his gun over Alard fields. But he merely
urged her again to come up to Fourhouses, and slack after her
conflict, she gave way and turned with him.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“Are you bothered much with rabbits?” she asked as they
walked up the hill. “We’re simply over-run with them at
Conster.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’re pretty bad, especially now the corn’s up. I generally
take out my gun when I go round the place.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But is this your land?—I thought I was still on ours.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is the land I have just bought from your father, Miss
Alard. It was yours three months ago, but it belongs to Fourhouses
now.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 15</h3>

<p class='c014'>Jenny had known before that love could make her superstitious—only
under its influence had she occasionally respected
the mascots, charms, black cats and other gods of the age, or
yielded to the stronger, stranger influences of buried urgencies
to touch and try.... But she was surprised at the sudden
relief which she felt at Godfrey’s words. She tried to reason
herself out of the conviction that she had definitely crossed the
frontier and could now never go back. She could not help
feeling like one of those escaped prisoners of war she had
sometimes read of during the last five years, who passed
unaware the black and orange boundary posts of Holland, and,
after hiding for hours from what they took for German
sentries, found themselves at last confronted by the friendly
Dutch guards. In vain she told herself that it made no difference
whether she met Godfrey on land belonging to Conster
or to Fourhouses—she was in the grip of something stronger
than reason; she could not argue or scold herself out of her
follies.</p>

<p class='c015'>The answer to all her questionings was now pretty plain.
She was coming to Fourhouses for the man, not for escape.
No need of her own could have made a fool of her like this.
She was not fancying herself in love with Ben Godfrey—she
really loved him, attracted physically at first, no doubt, but as
she advanced finding ever more and more solid reason for
attachment. She wanted him, and why in the world shouldn’t
she have him?—if he had been rich, not even the lowest rank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>would have made him ineligible in her people’s eyes. But
because he was only “comfortable,” only had enough to live on
in peace and happiness and dignity, her family would be horrified
at such an alliance—“a common farmer,” she could hear
them calling him, and her cheeks reddened angrily as she
walked up the hill.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you tired?” asked Godfrey—“let me carry your coat—it’s
a terrible hot day.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She let him relieve her, pleased at the accidental touch of
his hand under the stuff. She wondered if he would say “I
beg your pardon” as he had said the first time. But he was
silent, indeed the whole of the way to Fourhouses he said very
little, and she wondered if he was pondering her in his mind,
perhaps asking himself why she had come, trying to argue
away his surprise, telling himself it was just a lady’s way to
be impulsive and tramp five miles to buy a mongrel pup she
had scarcely noticed the day before. Now and then his glance
crept towards her, sweeping sideways from deepset blue eyes,
under the fringe of dark lashes. She liked his eyes, because
they were not the brown bovine eyes of the mixed race who
had supplanted the original South Saxons, but the eyes of the
Old People, who had been there before the Norman stirred
French syllables into the home-brew of Sussex names. They
were the eyes of her own people, though she herself had them
not, and they would be the eyes of her children&#160;... she felt
the colour mounting again, but this time it was not the flush
of indignation, and when next she felt his gaze upon her, her
own was impelled to meet it. For the first time on that walk
to Fourhouses their eyes met, and she saw that his face was as
red as hers with the stain of a happy confusion.</p>

<p class='c015'>When they came to the farm, he invited her in, saying that
he would bring her the puppies. For a moment she saw him
hesitate at the parlour door, but to her relief he passed on,
leading the way to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mother, here’s Miss Alard come again to see Lizzie’s pups”—he
ushered her in rather proudly, she thought, standing back
against the door which he flung wide open.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>“You’re welcome,” said Mrs. Godfrey—“please sit down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She was ironing at the table, but stopped to pull forward a
chair to the window, which was open. There was no fire in
this, the big outer room, but from a smaller one within came
the sound of cracking wood and occasional bursts of singing.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m afraid I’ve come at an awkward time,” said Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, no—we’re never too busy here—and Ben ull be proud
to show you the little dogs, for all he makes out to look down
on them, they being no sort of class and him a bit of a fancier
as you might say. You’ve had a hot walk, Miss Alard—can I
get you a drink of milk? It’s been standing in the cool some
while and ull refresh you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny was grateful and glad. Mrs. Godfrey fetched her the
milk in a glass from the dairy, then went back to her ironing.
She was a stout, middle-aged woman, bearing her years in a
way that showed they had not been made heavy by too much
work or too much childbearing. She could still show her good
white teeth, and her hair had more gloss than grey in it. She
talked comfortably about the weather and the haymaking till
her son came back with the two most presentable of Lizzie’s
family.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you’ll be kind enough to take one of these little chaps,
Miss Alard....”</p>

<p class='c015'>They spent twenty minutes or so over the puppies, and in
the end Jenny made her choice and accepted his gift.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He won’t be ready to leave his mother for a week or two
yet.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll come back and fetch him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Won’t you come before then?”</p>

<p class='c015'>They were alone in the great kitchen—Mrs. Godfrey had
gone into the inner room to heat her iron, and they stood
between the table and the window, Jenny still holding the puppy
in her arms. The moment stamped itself upon her memory
like a seal. She would always remember that faint sweet scent
of freshly ironed linen, that crack of a hidden fire, that slow
ticking of a clock—and Ben Godfrey’s face before her, so
brown, strong and alive, so lovable in its broad comeliness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>The last of her reserve dropped from her—he ceased to be a
problem, a choice, a stranger; he became just a fond, friendly
man, and her heart went out to him as to a lover, forgetting
all besides.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, of course I’ll come”—she said gently—“when ever you
want me.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 16</h3>

<p class='c014'>The rest of that day did not seem quite real—perhaps because
she would not let herself think of what she had done in
the morning, what she had committed herself to. And when
the day was over and she lay flat on her back in her bed, with
the bedclothes up to her chin, the morning still seemed like
something she had watched or dreamed rather than something
she had lived.</p>

<p class='c015'>She did not actually live till the next day at breakfast, when
she turned over the letters beside her plate. Among them lay
one in handwriting she did not know, small and laborious.
She looked at the postmark and saw it was from Icklesham,
and immediately found herself tingling and blushing. Her first
impulse was to put it away and read it in solitude later on,
but a contrary impulse made her open it at once—partly because
she could not bear the suspense, and partly because she
could not bear the shame of her own foolishness. Why should
she be so sure it was from Fourhouses? Ben Godfrey was not
the only person she knew in Icklesham&#160;... though the only
person she knew who was likely to write in that careful, half-educated
hand.... Yes, it was from Fourhouses.</p>

      <div class='line'><em>My dear Miss Alard</em>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>I hope this letter finds you in the best of health, and I hope
you will not think I am taking a liberty to ask if you could
meet me by the Tillingham Bridge on the road from Brede
Eye to Horns Cross next Thursday afternoon at three p.m.
I have something very particular to say to you. Ever since
you were kind enough to call this morning and said you would
come back any time I wanted I have been thinking that perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span> you would like my freindship. Dear Miss Alard, I hope
you do not think I am taking a liberty, and if you do not want
my freindship perhaps you will kindly let me know. But ever
since you came over with Mr. Peter Alard I thought perhaps
you would like my freindship. I must not say any more.
But I would like to talk to you on Thursday at three p.m. if
you will meet me on the Tillingham Bridge by Dinglesden
Farm. I think that is better than me coming to your house—[“yes,
I think so too,” said Jenny]—and I should be very
much obliged  if you would come. My dear Miss Alard I
hope you do not think I am taking a liberty on so short an
acquaintance, but I feel I should like to be your friend. If
you would rather not have my freindship perhaps you will
kindly let me know. Having no more to say, I will now draw
to a close.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours sincerely,</div>
      <div class='line in8'><span class='sc'>Benjamin Godfrey</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Jenny was half surprised to find herself choking with
laughter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here I am, down to brass tacks,” she thought to herself—“I
must put this letter with the best parlour and the Sunday
clothes”&#160;... then suddenly, deep in her heart—“Oh, the
darling! the darling!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your letters seem to be amusing,” said Doris from the
other end of the table.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, they are.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wish mine were. I never seem to get anything but bills.
I’m glad you’re more lucky—though I expect it makes a difference
not hearing from Jim.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, we never corresponded much—we met too often.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was always the other way round with me&#160;... the piles
of letters I used to get.... I expect you remember.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny could remember nothing but a fat letter which appeared
every other day for about three weeks, from an Indian
civil servant who was presumptuous enough to think himself
fit to mate with Alard.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“Well, I’ve had my good times,” continued Doris, “so I
oughtn’t to grumble. Things seem to have been different when
I was your age. Either it was because there were more men
about, or”—she smiled reminiscently. “Anyhow, there weren’t
any gaps between. I put an end to it all a little while ago—I
had to—one finds these things too wearing&#160;... and I didn’t
want to go on like Ninon de l’Enclos—I don’t think it’s
dignified.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perhaps not,” said Jenny absently. She was wondering
what Doris would say to her letter if she could see it.</p>

<p class='c015'>After breakfast she took it up to the old schoolroom and
read it again. This time it did not make her laugh. Rather,
she felt inclined to cry. She thought of Ben Godfrey sitting
at the kitchen table with a sheet of note-paper and a penny
bottle of ink before him—she saw him wiping his forehead and
biting his penholder—she saw him writing out the note over
and over again because of the blots and smudges that would
come. Yes, she must remember the debit side—that he was
not always the splendid young man she saw walking over his
fields or driving his trap. There were occasions on which he
would appear common, loutish, ignorant.... But, and this
was the change—she saw that she loved him all the better for
these occasions—these betraying circumstances of letter writing,
best parlour and best clothes, which seemed to strip him
of his splendour and show him to her as something humble,
pathetic and dear.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dear Mr. Godfrey,” she said to herself—“I shall be very
humbly grateful for your freindship&#160;... and I can’t imagine
it spelt any other way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She found it very difficult to answer the letter, as she was
uncertain of the etiquette which ruled these occasions. Evidently
one said little, but said it very often. In the end all
she did was to write saying she would meet him on the
Tillingham bridge, as he suggested. She thought it was rather
rash of him to appoint a tryst on her father’s land, but they
could easily go off the road on to the marsh, where they were
not likely to be seen.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>She posted the letter herself in the box at the end of the
drive, then gave herself up to another twenty-four hours’ in reality
of waiting.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 17</h3>

<p class='c014'>The next day was heavy with the threat of thunder. The
ragged sky hung low over the trees, and clouds of dust blew
down the lanes, through the aisles of the fennel. Jenny was
exactly punctual at her tryst. She did not know whether or
not he would expect to be kept waiting, but she had resolved
to weigh this new adventure by no false standards of coquetry,
and walked boldly on to Dinglesden bridge just as the thin
chimes of Conster’s stable-clock came across the fields.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was nowhere in sight, but in a couple of minutes he
appeared, riding this time on a big-boned brown horse, who
swung him along at a slow, lurching pace. Evidently he had
not expected to find her there before him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Directly he caught sight of her he jerked the reins and finished
the last hundred yards at a canter, pulling up beside her
on the crest of the bridge.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good-day, Miss Alard. I hope I haven’t kept you waiting.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She was pale with shyness. Hitherto she had never, under
any circumstances, felt ill at ease with a man, but now she was
incomprehensibly too shy to speak. He had dismounted, and
was leading his horse towards the gate opening on the marsh
by Dinglesden Farm. She found herself walking beside him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Bit thundery,” he remarked—“maybe we’ll have a storm.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not sure—it may blow over. I hope it does, for I’ve
still a couple of fields uncut.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The hay’s been good this year.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not so bad—but a bit stalky.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They were through the gate now, walking side by side over
the grass-grown, heavy rutted track that leads past the barns
of Dinglesden down the Tillingham marsh, between the river
and the hop-gardens. Jenny was glad they were off the road—soon
they would be out of sight of it. The hop-gardens that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>covered the slope and threw a steamy, drowsy scent into the
heaviness of the day, would hide them completely from anyone
who went by. She began to feel very much alone with Godfrey&#160;... and still neither of them spoke. They had not spoken
since they had left the road.</p>

<p class='c015'>Only a few hundred yards brought them to the turn of the
valley, where the Tillingham swings southward towards Rye.
Behind them the farm and the bridge were shut out by the
sloping hop-gardens, before them the marsh wound, a green
street, between the sorrel-rusted meadows, with the Mocksteeple
standing gaunt and solitary on the hill below Barline.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s very good of you to have come,” said Ben.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I—I wanted to come.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He checked his horse, and they stood still.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You—you don’t think it cheek—I mean, that I’m taking a
liberty—in wanting to know you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“When you came that evening to the farm, I—I wanted to
say all sorts of things, and I didn’t like&#160;... for I didn’t
know....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I should like to be your friend.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her voice came firmly at last.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I should like to be your friend,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c015'>She knew what the word “friend” meant in his ears. “My
friend” was what a girl of his class would say when she meant
“my lover.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, then....”</p>

<p class='c015'>He took her hand and blushed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let’s sit down for a bit,” he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>A stripped and fallen tree lay on the grass, and they sat
down on it when he had hitched his horse to the fence of the
hop-garden. Long hours seemed to roll by as they sat there
side by side&#160;... the sun came out for a moment or two, sending
the shadow of the hop-bines racing over the ground.
There was a pulse of thunder behind the meadows in the
north. Then suddenly, for some unfathomable reason, Jenny
began to cry.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>At first he seemed paralysed with astonishment, while she
leaned forward over her knees, sobbing uncontrollably. But
the next moment his arms came round her, drawing her gently
up against him, her cheek against his homespun coat that smelt
of stables.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear&#160;... my little thing&#160;... don’t cry! What is it?—Are
you unhappy? What have I done?”</p>

<p class='c015'>She could not speak—she could only lift her face to his,
trying to smile, trying to tell him with her streaming eyes that
she was not unhappy, only silly, only tired. He seemed to
understand, for he drew her closer, and she could feel his whole
body trembling as he put his mouth shyly against hers.</p>

<p class='c015'>One or two drops of rain splashed into the ruts, and a moan
of wind suddenly came through the hop-bines. He lifted his
head, still trembling. He looked at her sidelong, as if for a
moment he expected her to be angry with him, to chide his
presumption. He would have taken away his arm, but she held
it about her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll get wet,” he said reluctantly—“we should ought to
move.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t care—I don’t want to move. Let me stay like this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then you aren’t angry with me for——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why should I be?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, we aren’t long acquainted....”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 18</h3>

<p class='c014'>During the next two months Jenny grew sweetly familiar
with that strip of marsh between the hop-gardens and the River
Tillingham. The Mocksteeple, standing out on the hill above
the river’s southward bend, had become one of many joyful
signs. Once more the drab, ridiculous thing looked down on
Alard loves, though now it was not a cynical Alard Squire
making sport of the country girls, but an Alard girl tasting
true love for the first time with a yeoman. Her earlier love affairs,
even that latest one with Jim Parish, became thin, frail
things in comparison.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Godfrey was contemptuous of Jim.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He couldn’t have loved you, or he’d never have let you go.
He’d have let his place go first.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Would you let Fourhouses go for me, Ben?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Reckon I would.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thank God you haven’t got to choose.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sorry I haven’t got to choose, for I’d like to show you.”
“Well, I’m glad, for whichever way you chose it ud  be hard
for you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—not hard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You don’t know, because you’re safe; you haven’t even got
to think of it. But I’m sorry for some of our men—yes, for
Jim Parish, and even for Peter. You see, it’s not merely
choosing for themselves. They have their families to consider.
You can’t dish all your relations just because you want to get
married.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Love was making her soft in judgment.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No relation that had any heart would stand in the way of
a young chap’s marrying a good girl. My mother ud sooner
turn out and live in a cottage than see me go without a wife.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But would you turn your mother out, Ben?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’d all go out together—for my wife.”</p>

<p class='c015'>His love-making was a delightful blend of diffidence and
ardour. At first it had been difficult to show him that she was
touchable, approachable to caresses. Yet once she had shown
him the way, he had required no more leading. He had a
warm, gentle nature, expressing itself naturally in fondness.
His love for her seemed to consist in equal parts of passion
and affection. It lacked the self-regarding element to which
she was accustomed, and though it held all the eager qualities
of fire, there was about it a simplicity and a shyness which
were new to her. After a time she discovered that he had a
mind like a young girl’s, and an experience very nearly as
white. He had spent his life in the society of animals and
good women, and the animals had taught him to regard them
not as symbols of license but as symbols of order, and the
women had taught him that they were something more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>animals. He had the fundamental cleanness of a man who
takes nature naturally.</p>

<p class='c015'>There had been another surprise for her, too, and this had
lain in his attitude towards her position and her family. She
discovered that his deference for her was entirely for her as a
woman, and he had no particular respect for her as an Alard.
His courtship would have been as diffident if she had been the
daughter of the farmer of Glasseye or the farmer of Ellenwhorne.
He was grateful to her for loving him, and infinitely
careful of her love, as a privilege which might be withdrawn,
but he saw no condescension in her loving him, no recklessness
in her seeking him. Indeed, the only time she found a stiffness
in him was when she told him that their love would have to
be secret as far as her family was concerned. He had come
to see her openly and innocently at Conster, and though luckily
her people had been out, and she had been able to convey to
the servants that he had only called on business, she had had
to warn him that he must not come again.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But why not?—I’m not ashamed of loving you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It isn’t that, Ben.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nor ashamed of myself, neither.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, darling, can’t you understand that it’s because of my
parents—what they’ll think and say—and do, if they get the
chance?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mean they won’t hold with us marrying?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—they won’t hold with it at all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I expect they’d like you to marry a lord.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It isn’t so much a lord that they want as someone with
money.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’ve got plenty of that, my lovely.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not what they’d call plenty—they want a really rich man,
who’ll be able to put us on our feet again.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Reckon he’d be hard to find. You’d need fifty thousand
to do that, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny nodded.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thank God,” he said, “my lands  free.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“You’re lucky.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s only because I haven’t bitten off more than I can chew,
nor my father before me. That piece I bought from your
father is the first that Fourhouses has bought for sixty years.
We’re not grand landlords, us. Maybe”&#160;... he hesitated a
moment&#160;... “your father and mother ud think you were
marrying beneath you to marry me. I reckon we’re not gentry,
and I was sent to the National School. But my folk have had
Fourhouses two hundred year, and we’ve kept ourselves honest,
for all that my grandfather married a gipsy. There was a lady
I met on leave in Egypt asked me to marry her,” he added
naïvely, “and Lord! she was beautiful and had lovely gowns,
and was a great man’s widow. But I couldn’t feel rightly
towards her, so I declined the favour she would do me, but
was honoured all the same. What are you laughing at, duck?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not at you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She realised that the war was probably in part responsible
for his failure to see the barriers between them—its freedoms
coupled with his own inherited consciousness of a good inheritance
and an honest history. She was not sorry for this—it
showed that he was aware of no maladjustments in their
comradeship, in their tastes, views, thoughts, ideas, which now
they exchanged freely. It made their courtship much more
natural. All she feared was his resentment at her family’s
attitude.</p>

<p class='c015'>But she found him unexpectedly mild on this point. His
self-respect was solid and steady enough not to be shaken by
what would have upset a man standing less securely. He was
proud of his yeoman birth, his prosperous farm and free
inheritance, and could laugh at the contempt of struggling,
foundering Conster. Moreover, he loved Jenny, and, since she
loved him, could forgive those who did not think him good
enough for her. He agreed that their engagement should be
kept from her people, though it was known to his, till she could
find a proper time for disclosing it. Meanwhile they met either
at Fourhouses, where the kindly, dignified welcome of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>mother and sisters saved their love from any sordid touch of
the clandestine, or else, nearer Jenny’s home, at Brede Eye
or the Mocksteeple.</p>

<p class='c015'>As time went on she felt the necessity of taking at least one
member of her family into her confidence—partly to make
contrivance more easy, and partly as a help in the ultimate crisis
which must come before long. Ben was slow in his methods,
and did not belong to a class who made marriages in haste, but
she knew that the last months of the year would probably be
crucial. She would then have somehow to declare herself, and
she saw the need for an ally.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of course there was only Gervase. She knew that he alone
was in the least likely to take her part; and in spite of her
growing approach to Peter, she realised that it would be folly
to turn to him now. He had married a girl whose grandfather
Ben Godfrey’s grandfather would have despised, nevertheless
he would be horror-stricken at the marriage she proposed to
make—he would talk as if she was marrying beneath her, as
if she was making herself cheap and degrading her name. She
could not bear it.... No, Peter would have to stay outside.
Gervase was altogether different—he had accomplished his own
revolt, and would encourage hers. Besides, he had always been
her special brother, and though lately his new interests and
long absences had a trifle estranged them, she knew she had
only to turn to him to find their old alliance standing.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was with this special decision that she came from the
Mocksteeple one evening in September. She had told Ben
that she meant to confide in Gervase, and he had agreed, though
she knew that he too was sorry it could not be Peter. She felt
the approach of relief—it would be a relief to have someone
with whom she could discuss her difficulties, on whose occasional
co-operation she could depend, and whose goodwill
would support her during the catastrophic days of disclosure.
Gervase seemed greater to her in all these capacities than he
seemed to Ben. She knew that Ben thought him a mere boy,
whose knowledge of their circumstances might, far from giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>them support, actually lead to their confusion. But Jenny
still had her queer new respect for Gervase. No doubt he was
a hothead, a rather uncritical revolutionary; but his ideas
seemed lately to have grown more stable; they seemed less
ready-made, more the fruit of his own thinking. His contempt
of his people’s gods had no longer such a patent origin in
youthful bumptiousness, but seemed rather due to the fact of
his having built his own holy places. She wondered what
had taught him wisdom—which of the new elements that had
lately come into his life. Was it work, religion, love, or
merely his growing older?</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 19</h3>

<p class='c014'>She did not find an opportunity for speaking to him alone
till after dinner. He went out, saying that he had some work
to do at the garage, and as Rose Alard had dined at Conster
and now made the fourth at bridge, Jenny was soon able to
slip away after him.</p>

<p class='c015'>She found him guiding an electric light bulb to and fro
among the inward parts of the Ford. Gervase always did his
own cleaning and repairs, which meant a lot of hard work,
as the run to Ashford must be made every day, no matter how
dirty the roads and the weather, and the lorry, which had long
lost its youth when he first took it over, was now far advanced
in unvenerable old age.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hullo, Jenny,” he cried when he saw her—“so you’ve
escaped from the dissipations of the drawing-room.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, Rose is playing tonight, thank heaven! and I’ve come
out to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s good. I’m sorry to be in this uncivilised place, but
I can’t help it. Henry Ford has appendicitis, and I must
operate at once. He’s got one wheel in the grave, I’m afraid,
but with a little care and coddling I can make him last till I’m
through with Ashford.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“When will that be?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“Next January.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And what will you do then?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Get some sort of a job, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She thought he looked fagged and jaded, though it might
have been the light, and the ugliness of his dirty blue slops
buttoned up to his collarless chin. After all, now she came to
think of it, he must have a pretty hard life—up every morning
at six or earlier, driving fifteen miles to and fro in all weathers,
working hard all day, and then coming home late, generally to
finish the day with cleaning and repairs.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase,” she said abruptly—“are you happy?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, Jen—quite happy. Are you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Gervase....”</p>

<p class='c015'>He looked up at the change in her voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve something to tell you,” she said hurriedly—“I’m going
to be married.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What! To Jim Parish?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, no, not to him. That’s all over. Gervase, I want you
to stand by me; that’s why I’m telling you this. I’m making a
great venture. I’m marrying Ben Godfrey.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ben Godfrey....”</p>

<p class='c015'>He repeated the name vaguely. Evidently it conveyed
nothing to him. He was so much away that he heard little
of the talk of the estate.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes. The farmer of Fourhouses. Don’t you know him?
I’ve known him three months, and we love each other. Father
and Mother and Peter and everyone will be wild when they
know. That’s why I want to have you on my side.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jenny, dear....” He carefully deposited Henry Ford’s
appendix on the shelf, wiped his oily fingers on a piece of rag,
and came and sat beside her on the packing case where she
had perched herself—“Jenny, dear, this is too exciting for
words. Do tell me more about it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny told him as much as she could—how meeting Ben
Godfrey had set her mind on a new adventure and a new
revolt—how she had resolved not to let her chance slip by,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>but had let him know she cared—how eager and sweet his
response had been, and how happy life was now, with meeting
and love-making. Her manner, her looks, her hesitations told
him as much as her words.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You will stand by me, won’t you, Gervase?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course I will, Jen. But do you mind if I ask you one
or two questions?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ask whatever you like. As you’re going to help me, you’ve
a right to know.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, are you quite sure this is going to last?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear! I never thought you’d ask that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I daresay it sounds a silly and impertinent question. But
I must ask it. Do you think he’s pulled your heart away from
your judgment? And do you think it’s possible that you may
have been driven towards him by reaction, the reaction from
all that long, meandering, backboneless affair with Jim Parish,
and all the silly, trivial things that did for it at last? Don’t be
angry with me. I must put that side of the question to you,
or I’d never forgive myself.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you think I’ve never put it to myself? Oh, Gervase, it
was exactly what I thought at the beginning. I told myself it
was only reaction—only because I was bored. But when I met
him at Fourhouses I couldn’t help seeing it was more than that,
and now I know it’s real—I know, I <em>know</em>.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you tastes and ideas in common?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, plenty. He has very much the same sort of abstract
ideas as I have—thinks the same about the war and all that.
And he’s read, too—he loves Kipling, and Robert Service’s
poems, though he reads boys’ books as well. He really has a
better literary taste than I have—you know what Vera thinks
of my reading. And he’s travelled much more than I have,
seen more of the world. He’s been in Mesopotamia, and Egypt,
and Greece, and France. And yet he’s so simple and unassuming.
He’s much more of a ‘gentleman’ in his speech and
manners than lots of men I know.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you ever seen him in his Sunday clothes?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“Yes, I have, and survived. He wears a ready-made brown
suit with a white stripe in it. And that’s the worst there is
about him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What are his people like?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’re darlings. His mother is solid and comfortable and
motherly, and the girls are about my own age, but with much
better manners. When Ben and I are married, the others will
live in a part of the house which is really quite separate from
the rest—has a separate door and kitchen—the newest of the
four houses. Oh, I tell you, Gervase, I’ve faced everything—tastes,
ideas, family, Sunday clothes—and there’s nothing that
isn’t worth having, or at least worth putting up with for the
sake of the rest, for the sake of real comfort, real peace, real
freedom, real love....”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her eyes began to fill, and he felt her warm, sobbing breath
on his cheek.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jennie, I want to kiss you. But I should have to make too
many preparations first—take off my slops, wash my hands with
soda, and clean my teeth, because I’ve been smoking woodbines
all day. So I think I’d better put it off till Sunday. But I do
congratulate you, dear—not only on being in love but on being
so brave. I think you’re brave, Jenny; it’s so much more difficult
for a woman to break away than for a man. But you’d
never have found happiness in the family groove, and sometimes
I was afraid that&#160;... never mind, I’m not afraid now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And you’ll stand by me, Gervase?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course I will. But you’ve got to show me the young
man. I won’t stand by an abstraction. I want to see if I like
him as flesh and blood.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll take you over to Fourhouses on Saturday afternoon.
And I’m quite sure you’ll like him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve made up my mind to, so he’ll be a pretty hopeless washout
if I don’t. I wonder that I haven’t ever met him, but I
expect it’s being away so much.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny was about to enlarge further on her young man’s
qualities, when she remembered that there is nothing more tiresome
to an unprosperous lover than the rhapsodies of someone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>whose love is successful and satisfied. Gervase had loved
Stella Mount for two years—everybody said so—but nothing
seemed to have come of it. It must distress him to hear of
her happiness which had come so quickly. She wondered if
his worn, fagged look were perhaps less due to hardship than
to some distress of his love. She was so happy that she could
not bear to think of anyone being miserable, especially Gervase,
whom, next to Ben, she loved better than all the world. She
checked her outpourings, and took his grimy, oil-stained hand
in hers, laying it gently in her satin lap.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Kid—do tell me. How are things between you and Stella?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There aren’t any ‘things’ between me and Stella.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Gervase, don’t tell me you’re not in love with her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I won’t tell you anything so silly. Of course I’m in love
with her, but it’s not a love that will ever give her to me.
It can’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Because she doesn’t care for me in that way. I don’t suppose
she thinks of me as anything but a boy.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Doesn’t she know you love her?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She may—I daresay she does. But I’m sure she doesn’t
love me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you ever asked her?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, then&#160;... Gervase!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“One can find out that sort of thing without asking.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Indeed one can’t—not with a girl like Stella. If you didn’t
speak, she’d probably try very hard not to influence you in any
way, because she realises that there are difficulties, and would
be afraid of leading you further than you felt inclined.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I haven’t seen so very much of her lately. We never meet
except on Sundays. I can’t help thinking that she’s trying to
keep me at a distance.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perhaps she’s surprised at your not speaking. How long
have you been friends?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“About three years, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And all that time people have been bracketing you together,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and you’ve said nothing. I expect she’s wondering why on
earth you don’t make love to her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I shouldn’t dare.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not to Stella?—She seems to me a girl one could make
love to very easily.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I agree—once she’d said ‘yes.’ But she’s a girl one couldn’t
take risks with—she’d be too easily lost. I’ve a feeling that if
I made a move in that direction without being sure of her,
she’d simply go away—fade out. And I’m terrified of losing
the little I’ve got of her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you may lose her through not being bold enough. It
sickens a girl frightfully when a man hangs round and doesn’t
speak. The reason that she seems to avoid you now may be
that she’s offended.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jenny, you don’t know Stella. She’s so candid, so transparent,
that if she had any such feelings about me, I’d be sure
to see it. No, I think she stands away simply because she’s
found out that people are talking, and wants to keep me at
a distance.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you can’t be sure. You may be quite mistaken. If I
was a man I’d never let things go by default like that. She
won’t ‘fade out’ if you do the thing properly. Women are
always pleased to be asked in marriage—at least if they’re
human, and Stella’s human if she’s nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And so am I. That’s why I can’t bear the thought of her
saying ‘no.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll be surprised if she says ‘no.’ But anyhow I’d rather
lose a good thing through its being refused me than through
not having the spirit to ask for it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I think you’re right there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He fell into a kind of abstraction, stroking his chin with one
hand, while the other still lay in her lap. Then he rose suddenly
and went over to the shelf where he had put his tools.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I can’t leave Henry Ford with his inside out while
I talk about my own silly affairs. You may be right, Jen—I
dunno. But I’m frightfully, ever so, glad about you—you
dear.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“Thank you, Gervase. It’s such a relief to have you on my
side.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“When are you going to spring it on the family?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, not just yet—not till Christmas, perhaps. We want
to have everything settled first.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think you’re wise.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Remember, you’re coming with me to Fourhouses on Saturday.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Rather! That’s part of the bargain. I must see the young
man.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And I’m sure you’ll like him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can very nearly promise to like him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She went up to him and put her hands on his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good night, old boy. I must be going in now—I suppose
you’re here till bed time?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And beyond—good night, Jenny.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase, you’re getting thin—I can feel your bones.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d be ashamed if you couldn’t. And do run along—I’ve
just had a vision of Wills carrying in the barley water tray.
Clairvoyantly I can see him tripping over Mother’s footstool,
clairaudiently I can hear Father saying ‘Damn you, Wills.
Can’t you look where you’re going?’... Leave the busy surgeon
now, there’s a dear.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He stepped back from under her hands, and thoughtfully
held up Henry Ford’s appendix to the light.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 20</h3>

<p class='c014'>Jenny had made more impression than she knew on Gervase’s
ideas of Stella. Hitherto he had always tacitly accepted
a tolerated position—she had allowed him to go for walks with
her, to come and see her on Sundays, to write to her, to talk
to her endlessly on the dull topic of himself; she had always
been friendly, interested, patient, but he had felt that if she
loved him she would not have been quite all these—not quite
so kind or friendly or patient. And lately she had withdrawn
herself—she had found herself too busy to go for walks, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>in her father’s house there was always the doctor or the priest.
He respected and thought he understood her detachment.
People were “talking,” as long ago they had “talked” about
her and Peter, and she wanted this new, unfounded gossip
to die.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now it struck him that there was a chance that Jenny might
be right, and that Stella fled before the gossip not because she
wanted to disprove it, but because she wished it better founded,
was perhaps a little vexed with him that it was not. Of course,
if all these three years she had been wanting him to speak....
For the first time he saw a certain selfishness in his conduct—he
was ashamed to realise that he had been content with his
position as hopeless lover, so content that he had never given
a thought to wondering if it pleased her. There had been a
subtle self-indulgence in his silent devotion.... “Lord! I
believe it’s as bad as if I’d pestered her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But he really could not believe that if Stella loved him he
would not know it. One of her chief qualities was candour,
and she was impulsive enough to make him think that she
would readily give expression to any attraction that she felt.
If Jenny, who was so much more cold and diffident, could have
been quickened by love into taking the first step towards Ben
Godfrey, how much more swiftly and decisively would ardent
Stella move when her heart drove her. Of course she might
see the drawbacks and dangers of marrying a man so much
younger than herself—she might have held back for his sake&#160;... perhaps that was why she was holding back now....
But he did not really think so—love was the last emotion that
a nature like Stella’s could hide, however resolute her will.</p>

<p class='c015'>There seemed no way of solving his doubts but to do as
Jenny suggested and to ask her. He shrank from putting his
fate to the test.... But that was only part of this same
selfishness he had discovered. By speaking, he could harm
nobody but himself. He might indeed turn himself out of
Paradise, that garden of hopeless loving service which was
home to him now. But he could not hurt or offend Stella—she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>could not accuse him of precipitancy after three years—and
if it was true that she cared, as might be just possible,
then he would have put an end to a ridiculous and intolerable
state of things.</p>

<p class='c015'>In this indecision he went with Jenny to Fourhouses on
Saturday. He did not talk to her about his own affairs—for
hers were too engrossing for both of them. She was desperately
anxious that he should like Ben Godfrey, not only because
it would put their alliance on firm and intimate ground, but
because she wanted her brother’s friendship to apologise and
atone to her lover for the slights of the rest of her family.
As she grew in love for Ben and in experience of his worth
she came fiercely and almost unreasonably to resent what she
knew would be the attitude of her people towards him. She
came more and more to see him from his own point of view—a
man as good as Alard, and more honourably planted in the
earth. She marvelled at herself now because she had once
thought that she was stooping—she laughed at her scheme for
holding out the sceptre.</p>

<p class='c015'>But though she was anxious, she was not surprised that the
two men should like each other. Ben Godfrey had all the
qualities that Gervase admired, and young Alard was by this
time quite without class consciousness, having lost even the
negative kind which comes from conscientious socialism. He
had had very little of congenial male society during the last two
and a half years, as his work at Ashford had kept him chiefly
among men with whom he had little in common. The farmer
of Fourhouses belonged altogether to a different breed from
the self-assertive young mechanics at Gillingham and Golightly’s&#160;... there was no need to warn Jenny here of fatal
differences in the pursuit of wealth, women and God.</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase was very favourably impressed by all he saw, and
came home a little envious of his sister. She had found a
happiness which particularly appealed to him, for it was of
both common and adventurous growth. She would be happy
in the common homely things of life, and yet they would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>be hers in quite the common way—she would hold them as an
adventurer and a discoverer, for to win them she would have
dared and perhaps suffered much.</p>

<p class='c015'>That was how Gervase wanted happiness—with double roots
in security and daring. He wondered if only the kingdom of
heaven was happy in that way, and if he could not find homeliness
and adventure together on earth. He did not want one
without the other, he did not want peace with dullness, nor
excitement with unrest. He had learned that the soul could
know adventure with profoundest quiet—might not the body
know it too? Walking home in the sunset from Fourhouses,
Gervase longed for the resurrection of the body—for
his body to know what his soul knew; and his heart told him
that only Stella could give him this, and that if she would not,
he must go without it.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 21</h3>

<p class='c014'>On Sunday mornings Gervase always went to see his mother
before breakfast. It was to make up, he said, for seeing so
little of her during the rest of the week. Lady Alard was
subtly pleased and flattered by these visits. No one else ever
paid them. He would sit on the bed and talk to her—not as
the rest of the family talked, in a manner carefully adapted to
her imbecility, but as one intelligent being to another, about
politics and books and other things she could not understand.
This pleased her all the more because he was careful to suggest
her part of the conversation as well as carrying on his own;
he never let her expose her ignorance. And though she secretly
knew he was aware of it, and that he knew that she knew, the
interview never failed to raise her in her own esteem, as a
mother in whom her son confided.</p>

<p class='c015'>This particular Sunday he stayed rather longer than usual,
giving her the right attitude towards Queen Victoria, as to
which she had always been a little uncertain. He had just
been reading Lytton Strachey’s <cite>Life</cite>, and they laughed together
over the tartan upholstery of Balmoral, and shook their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>heads and wondered over John Brown. From John Brown
the conversation somehow wandered to Gervase’s work at Ashford,
and finally ended in a discussion of the days not so very
far ahead when he should have finished at the workshop and
be his own master.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What shall I do with myself then, Mother? Shall I open
a garage in Leasan, so that you can sack Appleby and sell the
car, and hire off me? Or would you like just to sack Appleby
and let me drive the car? You’d find me most steady and
reliable as a shuvver, and it would be such fun having tea
with the maids when you went calling.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wish you’d taken up a more dignified profession. There
really doesn’t seem to be anything for you to do now that isn’t
rather low.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m afraid I like doing low things, Mother. But I really
don’t know what I’m going to do when I leave Gillingham’s.
It’s funny—but my life seems to stop at Christmas. I can’t
look any further. When I first went into the works I was
always making plans for what I’d do when I came out of them.
But now I can’t think of anything. Well, anyhow, I’ve got
more than three months yet—there’ll be time to think of something
before then. Did you know that I start my holiday next
week?—Ten whole, giddy days—think of that!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Shall you be going away?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I don’t think so. A man I was with at Winchester
asked me to come and stop with his people. But he lives in
Scotland, and I can’t afford the journey. Besides it wouldn’t
be worth it just for a week.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I thought you said you’d got ten days.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—but I’m going to spend four of them at Thunders
Abbey near Brighton. Father Luce thought it would be a good
idea if I went to a retreat.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Gervase!—is it a monastery?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The very same. It’s the chief house of the Order of Sacred
Pity.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, my dear—are you—oh, you’re not going to become a
monk?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“No fear—I’m just going into retreat for four days, for the
good of my soul.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I don’t know what a retreat is, but I feel it would
do you much more good if you went to Scotland. You’re
looking quite white and seedy. Are you sure your heart’s
all right? You know we’ve got angina in the family. I’ve
had it for years and years, and poor George died of it. I’m
so afraid you’ve got it too.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I haven’t—honour bright. I’m looking white because I
want a holiday—and I’m going to have one—for both body
and soul.... And now I really must go down to breakfast
or I shan’t be able to get more than my share of the
kidneys.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sunday breakfast was an important contrast with the breakfasts
of the week. On week-days he either scrambled through
a meal half-cooked by the kitchen-maid, or shared the dry
short-commons of Father Luce’s cottage. On Sundays he ate
his way exultingly through porridge, bacon, kidneys, toast
and honey, with generally three cups of coffee and a slice of
melon. As a rule the family were all down together on Sunday,
having no separate engagements, but an hour of united
loafing before Appleby brought round the car to take to church
such of them as felt inclined for it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase had to start earlier—directly breakfast was over.
His Parish Mass was at half-past ten, in consideration for
Vinehall’s Sunday dinners, since there the rich and the poor
were not separated into morning and evening congregations.
Also he was Master of the Ceremonies, and had to be in the
sacristy well before the service began, to make the usual preparations,
and exhort and threaten the clumsy little servers,
who came tumbling in at the last moment with their heads full
of Saturday’s football. Gervase was not a ritualist, and his
aim was to achieve as casual an effect as possible, to create
an atmosphere of homeliness and simplicity round the altar.
But so far he had got no nearer his ideal than a hard-breathing
concentration—the two torch-bearers gripped their torches
as if they were to defend their lives with them, and the panting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>of the thurifer mingled with the racket of his cheap brass
censer.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was not till the sermon began that he had time to look
for Stella. When he had taken his seat in the Sanctuary with
his arms folded, and had seen that the three little boys were
also sitting with their arms folded instead of in more abandoned
attitudes, he was free to search for her face through
the incense-cloud that floated in the nave. He found her very
soon, for a ray of golden, dusty sunshine fell upon her as she
sat with her arm through Dr. Mount’s. The sunshine had
dredged all the warm brown and red tints out of her hair and
face, giving her a queer white and golden look that made her
unreal. As he looked at her, she smiled, and he found that
her smile had come in response to a smile of his which had
unknowingly stolen over his face as he watched her. Her
smile was rather sad, and he wondered if the sadness too was
a response.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Luce was delivering one of Newman’s Parochial Sermons
in his own halting words, and though Gervase always
made it a point of discipline to listen to sermons, however
much they bored him, he found that this morning attention
was almost impossible. Stella seemed to fix his thoughts so
that he could not drag them from her. He knew that his attitude
towards her was changing—it was becoming more disturbed,
more desperate. His heart must have been ready for
this change, for he did not think that Jenny’s words would
have had power to work it of themselves. He wondered where
it was leading him&#160;... he wondered if it had anything to
do with this feeling as of a ditch dug across his life at the
end of the year.... But probably his leaving the works
after Christmas would account for that. Well, anyhow, he
would have to put an end to the present state of affairs—they
were the result of mere selfishness and cowardice on his part.
Perhaps he ought to go away—leave Stella altogether, since
she did not love him and his heart was unquiet because of
her&#160;... he would have his chance to go away in January—right
away.... But he could not—he could never bear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>live away from her. And he had no certain knowledge that
she did not love him—perhaps she did—perhaps Jenny was
right after all.... “In the Name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 22</h3>

<p class='c014'>After Mass, Gervase and the Vicar walked together to
Hollingrove.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve heard from Thunders Abbey,” said Gervase to Luce,
“and there’s a vacancy for the eighteenth. So I shall go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wonder how you’ll like it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So do I. But I’m glad I’m going. They’re full up really,
but Father Lawrence said I could sleep at the farm.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then you’ll have to get up early. It’s fifteen minutes’ walk
from the Abbey, and Mass is at half-past six and of obligation.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Never mind—I’m used to hardships, though I know you
think I wallow in unseemly luxuries. But I’m getting keen
on this, Father. Whether I like it or not, I know it will be
exciting.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Exciting! That’s a nice thing to expect of a retreat.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, religion generally is exciting, isn’t it, so the more
I get the more exciting it’s likely to be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Um—too exciting perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What do you mean, Father?”</p>

<p class='c015'>But Luce would not tell him, and in another minute they
were at Dr. Mount’s cottage, where they always had mid-day
dinner on Sundays. It was cooked by Stella herself, helped
by the little maid, so she did not appear till it was ready. She
had changed her frock and bore no traces of her labours beyond
a face heated by the fire. Her cheeks were flushed and
her eyes bright—she looked absurdly young. How old was
she, Gervase wondered? Twenty-eight or twenty-nine? But
she did not look a bit over twenty. She did not look as old
as he did. It must be her vitality which kept her young like
this—her vitality&#160;... and the way she did her hair. He
smiled.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>“What are you smiling at, Gervase?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“At you, Stella.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And why at me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Because you look so absurdly young. And I’ve been very
knowing, and have decided that it’s the way you do your
hair.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Really, Gervase, you’re not at all gallant. Surely I look
young because I am young. If you think different you
oughtn’t to say so.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is a poor beginning for your career as a ladies’ man,”
said Dr. Mount.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Just as well he should start it on me,” said Stella—“then
he’ll know the technique better by the time it really matters.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her words stabbed Gervase—they showed him how he
stood with her. She did not take him seriously—or if she
did, she was trying to show him that it was all no use, that
he must give up thinking of her. The result was that he
thought of her with concentrated anxiety for the rest of the
meal, his thoughts making him strangely silent.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was not wanted at Catechism that afternoon, so he
could spend it with her, and for the first time he found the
privilege unwelcome. He remembered other Sunday afternoons
when he had lain blissfully slack in one of the armchairs,
while Stella curled herself up in the other with a
book or some sewing. They had not talked consecutively, but
just exchanged a few words now and then when the processes
of their minds demanded it—it had all been heavenly
and comfortable and serene.... He found himself longing
almost angrily to be back in his old attitude of contented hopelessness.
But he knew that he could never go back, though
he did not exactly know why. What had happened that he
could no longer find his peace in her unrewarded service?
Had he suddenly grown up and become dependent on realities—no
longer to be comforted with dreams or to taste the sweet
sadness of youth?</p>

<p class='c015'>He had half a mind to go for a walk this afternoon and
leave her—he knew that she would not try to make him stay.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>But, in spite of all, he hankered after her company; also
there was now growing up in him a new desire to come to
grips with her, to know exactly where he stood—whether,
though she did not want his love she still wanted his friendship,
or whether she would like him to go away. So when
Father Luce went off to his Catechism, and the doctor to see
a couple of patients at Horns Cross, Gervase stayed behind
in the sitting-room where they had had their coffee, and asked
Stella, according to custom, if she would mind his pipe.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You know, Gervase, you’re always allowed to smoke your
pipe if I’m allowed to mend my stockings. Neither is exactly
correct behaviour in a drawing-room, but if you dispense me
from the rules of feminine good-breeding, I’ll dispense you
from the rules of masculine etiquette.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He took out his pipe, and she fetched her work-basket
from the back of the sofa. Nothing could have looked more
domestic than the two of them sitting each side of the fire,
he smoking, she darning, both silent. But the unreality of it
vexed him this afternoon. He could not play the childish
game he had sometimes played, of pretending they were married,
and being content. “When I became a man I put away
childish things....” He wanted to have the power to go
over to her as she sat absorbed in her work, turn up her face
and kiss her—or else pick her off the chair and set her on
his knee....</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella,” he said gruffly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I want to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well&#160;... our friendship isn’t the same as it used to be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He would be furious if she contradicted him—or if she said
‘Oh, really? I haven’t noticed anything.’ But she said at
once—</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know it isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And what do you put that down to?”</p>

<p class='c015'>She hedged for the first time.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re trying to keep me at a distance.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She did not speak, but he saw the colour burning on the
face that she bent hurriedly over her work.</p>

<p class='c015'>He edged his chair closer, and repeated—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, you are, Stella—trying to keep me off.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I—I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You needn’t be sorry; but I wish you’d tell me why you’re
doing it. It isn’t that you’ve only just discovered that I love
you—you’ve always known that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m wasting your time, Gervase. I shouldn’t keep you
dangling after me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mean that I’ve hung about too long?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, no....” She was obviously distressed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella, I’ve loved you for years, and you know it—you’ve
always known it. But I’ve never asked anything of you or
expected anything. All I’ve wanted has been to see you and
talk to you and do anything for you that I could. It hasn’t
done me any harm. I’m only just old enough to marry, and
I have no means.... And up till a little while ago I was
content. Then you changed, and seemed to be trying to put
me off—it hurt me, Stella, because I couldn’t think why....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I can’t bear to hurt you.” To his surprise he saw
that her tears were falling. She covered her face.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella, my little Stella.”</p>

<p class='c015'>By leaning forward he could put his hand on her knee.
It was the first caress that he had ever given her, and the
unbearable sweetness of it made him shiver. He let his
hand lie for a few moments on her warm knee, and after a
time she put her own over it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase, I’m so sorry—I’m afraid I’ve treated you badly.
I let you love me—you were so young at first, and I saw it
made you happy, and I thought it would pass over. Then
people began to talk, as they always do, and I took no notice—it
seemed impossible, me being so much older than you—until
I found that&#160;... I mean, one day I met Peter, and he
really thought we were engaged....”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>It was not her words so much as the burst of bitter weeping
that followed them which showed Gervase the real state
of her heart. She still loved Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s nothing to regret, dear,” he said hurriedly—“you were
perfectly right. And now I understand....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But it’s wrong, Gervase, it’s wrong....” By some instinct
she seemed to have discovered that he guessed her secret&#160;... “it’s wrong; but oh, I can’t help it! I wish I could. It
seems dreadful not to be able to help it after all these
years.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She had gripped his hand in both hers—her body was stiff
and trembling.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella, darling, don’t be so upset. There’s nothing wrong
in loving—how could there be? Surely you know that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes I do. It’s not the loving that’s wrong, but letting my
whole life be hung up by it. Letting it absorb me so that
I don’t notice other men, so that I can’t bear the thought of
marrying anyone else—so that I treat you badly.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You haven’t treated me badly, my dear. Get that out of
your head at once.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have—because I’ve spoilt our friendship. I couldn’t go
on with it when I knew....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s high time our friendship was spoilt, Stella. It was
turning into a silly form of self-indulgence on my side, and
it ought to be put an end to. Hang it all! why should I get
you talked about?—apart from other considerations. You’ve
done me good by withdrawing yourself, because you’ve killed
my calf-love. For the last few weeks I’ve loved you as a
man ought—I’ve known a man’s love, though it’s been in
vain....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Gervase....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t think any more about me, dear; you’ve done me
nothing but good.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She had hidden her face in the arm of the chair, and he
suddenly saw that he must leave her. Since she did not love
him, his own love was not enough to make him less of an
intruder. There were dozens of questions he wanted to ask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>her—answers he longed to know. But he must not. He rose
and touched her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m going, my dear. It’s nearly time for Adoration. I
shan’t come back next Sunday—and later, next year, I’ll be
going away&#160;... don’t fret&#160;... it’ll all be quite easy.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It wasn’t easy now. She held out one hand without lifting
her head, and for a moment they held each other’s hands
in a fierce clasp of farewell. He felt her hot, moist palm
burning against his, then dropped it quickly and went out.</p>

<p class='c015'>So that was the end. He had finished it. But Stella herself
had taught him that one did not so easily finish love. He
supposed that he would go on loving her as she had gone
on loving Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was a quarter to four as he went into church. Quietly
and methodically he lit the candles for Devotions, and watched
the slight congregation assemble in the drowsy warmth of the
September afternoon. He could not feel acutely—he could not
even turn in his sorrow to the Sacred Victim on the Altar,
whose adoration brought the children’s service to a close.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O Sacred Victim, opening wide</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The gate of heaven to men below&#160;...”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The well-known words rose out of the shadows of the
aisles behind him. They bruised his heart with their familiar
sweetness.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our foes press round on every side,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thine aid supply, thy strength bestow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The candles that jigged in the small draughts of the sanctuary
blurred into a cloud of rising incense, and then more
thickly into a cloud of unshed tears. He fought them back,
ashamed. He was beginning to feel again, and he would
rather not feel—like this. It was intolerable, this appeal to
his bruised emotion—it was like compelling him to use a
wounded limb. He felt as if he could not bear any more of
the wan, lilting music, the faint, sweet voices of the faithful,
the perfumed cloud that rose like smoke before the altar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>and then hung among the gilding and shadows of the chancel
roof. And now the virile tenor of the Priest seemed to bring
a definitely sexual element into the tender dream.... What
was this he was saying about love?...</p>

<p class='c015'>“O God, who has prepared for them that <em>love</em> thee, such
good things as pass man’s understanding, pour into our
hearts such <em>love</em> towards thee, that we, <em>loving</em> thee above all
things....”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 23</h3>

<p class='c014'>The clear pale sunlight of late October glittered on the
River Tillingham, and seemed to be all light. No warmth was
in the evening ray, and Jenny’s woollen scarf was muffled to
her throat as she came to the Mocksteeple. From far off she
had seen the tall figure waiting beside the kiln. She wondered
if he would hear her footsteps in the grass, or whether
till she had called his name he would stand looking away
towards where the light was thickening at the river’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her feet made a sucking noise in the ground which was
spongy with autumn rains. He turned towards her and immediately
held out his arms.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My lovely....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She was enfolded.</p>

<p class='c015'>His warmth and strength made her think of the earth, and
there was a faint scent of earth about him as she hid her face
on his breast. There was also that smell of the clean straw
of stables which she had noticed when she first met him. She
rubbed her cheek childishly and fondly against the roughness
of his coat then lifted her mouth for his slow, hard kisses....
“My lovely—oh, my lovely.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How long can you stay?” he asked her a few minutes later,
when they had huddled down together under the wall of the
Mocksteeple, from which came a faint radiation of warmth,
as the tar gave out the heat it had absorbed during the day.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not very long, I’m afraid, Benjie. There are people
coming to dinner tonight, and I’ll have to be back in good time.
But we must fix about Monday. I’ve already told them I’m
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>going up to town for a day’s shopping, and I’ve written to a
friend to choose me a couple of frocks at Debenham’s and send
them down—to make the lie hold water. I’m afraid I’m getting
quite a resourceful liar.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you <em>are</em> going shopping, dear.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, but I can’t tell them it’s furniture, stupid. Oh, Ben,
won’t it be wildly exciting choosing things for Fourhouses!
But we mustn’t be extravagant, and you’ve got some lovely
bits already.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I want you to have the whole house to please you—nothing
in it that you don’t like.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I like everything except the parlour, and those iron bedsteads
they have upstairs. We’ll want some chests too, to
use instead of the washstands. Then Fourhouses will be perfect
inside and out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You have real taste—that’s what you have,” he said admiringly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s so dear of you to give me what I want.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s my wedding-present to you, sweetheart; and Mother
and the girls are giving you sheets and table linen, so reckon
we’ll be well set up in our housekeeping.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She drowsed against him, her head on his shoulder, her arm
across his knees. He put his mouth to her ear.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My sweet,” he murmured—“my little sweet—when is it
going to be?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve told you, Ben. At the beginning of January.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s your faithful word?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My faithful word.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m glad—for oh, my dearest, it seems I’ve waited long
enough.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It won’t seem so very long now—and, Ben, I’ve made up
my mind about one thing. I’m not going to tell the family
till it’s all over.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re not!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—because if I told them before it happened they’d
try to stop it; and though they couldn’t stop it, it would be a
nuisance having them try.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“Does your brother agree with this?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was he that suggested it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’ve a great respect for that brother of yours. But,
sweetheart, it seems so dreadful, us marrying on the quiet,
when I’m so proud of you and ud like to hold you before all
the world.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You shall hold me before all the world—after our marriage.
But there’s no good having a row with the parents,
especially as they’re old. It’ll be bad enough for them anyhow,
but I think they’ll take it easier if they know it’s too late to
do anything.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He acquiesced, as he usually did, for he respected her judgment,
and his natural dignity taught him to ignore this contempt
of Alard for Godfrey. The rest of their short time
together must not be spoiled by discussion. Once more he
drew her close, and his kisses moved slowly from her forehead
to her eyes, from her eyes to her cheeks, then at last
to her mouth. His love-making gave her the thrill of a new
experience, for she knew what a discovery and a wonder it
was to him. It was not stale with repetition, distressed with
comparison, as it was to so many men—as it was to herself.
She felt a stab of remorse, a regret that she too was not
making this adventure for the first time. She was younger
than he, and yet beside him she felt shabby, soiled....
She strained him to her heart in an agony of tender possession.
Oh, she would make his adventure worth while—he
should not be disappointed in experience. They would explore
the inmost heart of love together.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 24</h3>

<p class='c014'>Jenny was glad that the numbers in the drawing-room made
it unnecessary for her to sit down to cards. She and Rose
Alard had both cut out, and as Rose liked to sit and watch
the play, Jenny felt she had an excuse to mutter something
about “having one or two things to see to,” and escape from
the room. She wanted to be alone if only for half an hour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>just to savour again in memory the comfort of her lover’s
arms, his tender breathing, the warmth of his kisses and the
darkness of his embrace. She shut her eyes and heard him
say “My lovely&#160;... oh, my lovely!”</p>

<p class='c015'>A full moon was spilling her light over the garden, and
instinctively Jenny turned out of doors. She had put on her
fur coat, and the still, moon-dazzled night was many degrees
from frost. In the garden she would be sure of solitude, and
at the same time would not be without the response of nature,
so necessary to her mood. “One deep calleth another,” and
her heart in its new depth of rapture called to the moon and
trees and grass, and received from them an answer which
those self-absorbed human beings, crowded over cards, could
never give.</p>

<p class='c015'>She walked to and fro on the wide path beside the tennis
lawn then turned into the darkness of the shrubbery, threading
her way through moon-spattered arbutus and laurel till
she came to a little garden-house which had been built in
the reign of Queen Anne. It had the characteristics of its
age—solid brick walls, high deepset windows, and a white
pediment which now gleamed like silver in the light of the
moon. It had been built by the non-juring Gervase Alard,
and here he had studied after his deprivation of the Vicarage
of Leasan, and written queer crabbed books on a revised
liturgy and on reunion with the Eastern Church. No one
ever worked in it now, and it contained nothing but a bench
and a few dilapidated garden chairs—it would hold only just
enough warmth for her to sit down and rest.</p>

<p class='c015'>To her surprise she found it was not empty; a movement
startled her as she crossed the threshold, and the next moment
she discovered Gervase, leaning back in one of the chairs.
He was just a blot of shadow in the deeper darkness, except
where his face, hands and shirt front caught the moonshine
in ghostly patches of white.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hullo, Gervase—I’d no notion you’d come here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He had left the drawing-room before coffee was brought
in.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“I’ve been strolling about and got rather cold.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Same here. Is there a whole chair beside you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>At first she had been sorry to find him and had meant to
go away, but now she realised that he was the only person
whose company would not be loss.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If not, there’s one under me, and you shall have that....
Ah, here’s something luxurious with rockers. Probably you
and I are mad, my dear, to be sitting here. But I felt I simply
must run away from the party.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So did I.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She sat down beside him. In spite of the ghastly moonlight
that poured over his face, he looked well—far less haggard
than he had seemed in the kinder light a month ago. It
struck her that he had looked better ever since his holiday, and
his parting from Stella Mount, which he had told her of a few
days after it happened. He had had a bad time, she knew,
but he seemed to have come through it, and to have found
a new kind of settlement. As she looked at him more closely
in the revealing light, she saw that his mouth was perhaps a
little too set, and that there were lines between nose and chin
which she had not noticed before. He looked happy, but he
also looked older.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And how goes it, my dear?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, Gervase—extremely well.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She was too shy of intimate things to enquire how it went
with him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I saw Ben this afternoon,” she continued, “and I told
him what you and I thought about not telling the parents till
afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And did he agree?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, he agreed. I really think he’s been wonderful about
it all—when you consider how he must feel....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s got some sense of proportion—he’s not going to let
his love be spoilt by family pride. Jenny, if I’ve learnt anything
in these first years of my grown-up life, it is that love
must come before everything else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She was surprised at this from him.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“You would put it before religion?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Religion is the fulfilment of love.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She repelled the awkward feelings which invariably oppressed
her at the mention of such things. She wanted to know
more of this young brother of hers, of the conflicts in which
he triumphed mysteriously.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase, I wish I understood you better. I can’t make
out how it is that you, who’re so modern and even revolutionary
in everything else, should be so reactionary in your
religion. Why do you follow tradition there, when you
despise it in other things.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Because it’s a tradition which stands fast when all the
others are tumbling down. It’s not tradition that I’m out
against, but all the feeble shams and conventions that can’t
stand when they’re shaken.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But does religion stand? I thought it was coming down
like everything else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Some kinds are. Because they’re built on passing ideas
instead of on unchanging instincts. But Catholic Christianity
stands fast because it belongs to an order of things which
doesn’t change. It’s made of the same stuff as our hearts.
It’s the supernatural satisfaction of all our natural instincts.
It doesn’t deal with abstractions, but with everyday life. The
sacraments are all common things—food, drink, marriage,
birth and death. Its highest act of worship is a meal—its
most sacred figures are a dying man, and a mother nursing
her child. It’s traditional in the sense that nature and life
are traditional....”</p>

<p class='c015'>It was many months since she had heard him talk like this.
It reminded her of the old days when they were both at school,
and he had brought her all his ideas on men and things, all
his latest enthusiasms and discoveries.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jenny,” he continued, “I believe that we’ve come to the
end of false traditions—to the ‘removing of those things which
are shaken, that those things which cannot be shaken may
remain.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is there anything besides religion which can’t be shaken?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“Yes—my dear, the earth. The land will still be there
though the Squires go, just as the faith will still be there
though the Parsons go. The Parson and the Squire will go,
and their places will be taken by the Yeoman and the Priest
who were there before them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Go back to the Middle Ages?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Lord, no! Too much has happened since then. We’ve
got industry and machinery and science—we can’t go back
to sack and maypoles. What I mean is that, instead of the
country being divided among a few big landlords who don’t
and can’t farm their own land, it will be divided into a lot of
small farms of manageable size. Instead of each country
parish being in the charge of a small country gentleman who
has to keep up state on an income of two hundred a year, and
is cut off from his parishioners by his social position and the
iron gates of his parsonage, there’ll be a humble servant living
among them as one of themselves, set above them only
by his vocation. It’ll be a democracy which will have the
best of aristocracy kept alive in it. The Parson and the Squire
don’t belong to any true aristocracy—they’re Hanoverian
relics—and they’re going, and I’m glad.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I think they’re going all right, but I can’t feel so
glad as you, because I’m not so sure as to who will take their
place. The yeoman isn’t the only alternative to the squire—there’s
also the small-holder and the garden-city prospector.
As for the parson—I don’t know much about church affairs,
but I should think he’s just as likely to lose the spiritual side
of himself as the material, and we’ll have men that aren’t
much better than relieving officers or heads of recreation
clubs.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t try and burst my dream, Jenny. It’s a very good
sort of dream, and I like to think it will come true. And I
know it will come true in a sense, though possibly in a sense
which will be nonsense to most people. That’s a way some
of the best dreams have.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He was silent and thoughtful for a moment. Perhaps he
was thinking of another Gervase Alard, who had long ago
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>sat where he sat, and dreamed a dream which had not come
true.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But don’t let’s have any more of me and my dreams,” he
said after a while. “Talk to me about Ben. We started talking
about him, you know, and then drifted off into Utopia. I
should think that was a good sign.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m meeting him in London on Monday to do some shopping.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What are you going to buy?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Furniture. I want to pick up one or two really nice old
pieces for Fourhouses. They’re to be his wedding-present
to me. First of all we’ll go to Duke Street, and then to Puttick
and Simpson’s in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you going to refurnish the house?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, only get rid of one or two abominations. I had
thought of doing up the Best Parlour, but now I’ve decided
to let that stand. If I’m to be a farmer’s wife I must get
used to the Family Bible and aspidistras and wool mats.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think you’re wise. It’s just as well not to try to alter
more of his life than you can help.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t want to alter his life. I’m quite persuaded that
his life is better than mine. And as for him not having our
taste, or rather a different kind of bad taste from what we’ve
got—it doesn’t matter. I’ve made up my mind I must take
Ben as he comes and as a whole, and not try to ignore or alter
bits of him. I’m going to do the thing properly—make his
friends my friends, pour out tea for the old ladies of Icklesham,
ask the farmers who call round on business to stay to
dinner or supper, go to see them at their farms and make
friends with their wives. I know I can do it if only I do it
thoroughly and don’t make any reservations. Of course I’ll
go on being friends with our set if they’ll let me, but if they
won’t, it’s they who’ll have to go and not the others. Gervase,
I’m sick of Jenny Alard, and I’m thankful that she’s going
to die early next year, and a new creature called Jenny Godfrey
take her place.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear, you’re going to be very happy.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“I know I am. I’m going to be the only happy Alard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The only one?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—look at the others. There’s Doris, a dreary middle-aged
spinster, trodden on by both the parents, and always regretting
the lovers she turned down because they weren’t good
enough for the family. There’s Mary, living alone in private
hotels and spending all her money on clothes; there’s Peter,
who’s married a rich girl who’s too clever for him, and who—worst
of all—thinks he’s happy and has become conventional.
No—I can’t help it—I pity them all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And what about me, Jenny? You’ve left me out. Do you
pity me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>She had ignored him deliberately—perhaps because she did
not quite know where to place him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“O Gervase, I hope you’ll be happy—I’m sure you will, because
you’re different from the rest.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I’m sure too. I’m going to be happy—as happy as
you. I don’t quite know how”—and he gave her a wry smile—“but
I know that I shall be.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>“Father,” said Stella Mount—“I’m afraid I must go away
again.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Go away, child? Why?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I—I can’t fall out of love with Peter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I thought you’d fallen out of love with him long ago.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—I thought so too. But I can’t have done it really, or
if I did I must have fallen in again. I’m frightfully sorry
about it&#160;... leaving you a second time, just because I’m
not strong-minded enough to.... But it’s no use.... I
can’t help....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t worry, dear. If you’re unhappy you shall certainly
go away. But tell me what’s happened. How long have you
been feeling like this?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ever since I knew Peter still cared.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter!—he hasn’t said anything to you, has he?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, no—not a word. But I could see—I could see he
was jealous of Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How could he possibly be jealous of Gervase?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He was. I met him one day in Icklesham street, and he
congratulated me&#160;... he said someone had told him Gervase
and I were engaged....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The idea!—a boy six years younger than yourself!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I know. I never took him seriously—that was my
mistake. Peter was ever so worked up about it, and when
I told him it wasn’t true he seemed tremendously relieved.
And every time I’ve met him since his manner’s been different.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>I can’t describe it, but he’s been sort of shy and hungry—or
else restless and a bit irritable; and for a long time I could
see he was still jealous—and it worried me; I felt I couldn’t
bear doing anything Peter didn’t like, and I was wild at people
talking, and upsetting him, so I pushed off poor Gervase and
became cold and unfriendly.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is that why he’s given up coming here on Sundays?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—not exactly. We had rather a scene when he last
came, just before his holiday, and he said he wouldn’t come
back. You see he cares, Father—he cares dreadfully. I’m
ever so sick with myself for not having realised it. I was
so wrapped up in Peter.... I thought it was only a rave,
like what the Fawcett boy had—but now I’m sure he really
cares, and it must be terrible for him. That’s why I want
to go away, for I’ll never be able to care for anyone else while
I feel for Peter as I do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, my dear, it’s just as well you shouldn’t fall in love
with Gervase. He’s a nice boy, but he’s much too young.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I know—it isn’t that. It’s being sure that however
much he was the right age I couldn’t have cared—not because
of anything lacking in him—but because of what’s lacking
in me&#160;... because of all that I’ve given to Peter, and that
Peter can’t take.... Oh, Father, I’ve made some discoveries
since Gervase went. I believe I refused Tom Barlow because
of Peter. The reason I’m single now is because for years
I’ve been in love with a man I can’t have. And that’s wrong—I
know it’s wrong. It sounds ‘romantic’ and ‘faithful’ and all
that—but it isn’t really—it’s wrong. Not because Peter’s a
married man, but because I’m an unmarried woman. He’s
keeping me unmarried, and I ought to get married—I don’t
like Spinsters—and I know I was meant to be married.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So do I; and I’m sure that one day you will be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I can’t fall in love with anyone while I love Peter&#160;...
that’s why I must go away. I ought to go somewhere really
far, out of the country perhaps. I feel dreadful leaving you,
daddy, but I know I must go. It’s even more necessary than
it was the first time. And there’s no good saying I could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>help Peter if I stayed—I don’t help him—I can see that I
only make him unhappy; I’m not cold enough to be able to
help him. A calm strong dignified woman might be able to
help him, but I’m not that sort. I want his love, his kisses,
his arms round me.... I want to give.... O Father,
Father....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She sobbed breathlessly, her face hidden in the back of her
chair. Dr. Mount stood beside her in silence; then he touched
her gently and said—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t cry like that my dear—don’t—I can’t bear it. You
shall go away—we’ll both go away. I’ve been in this place
twenty years, and it’s time I moved on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you don’t want to go, and you mustn’t. You’re happy
here, and I’d never forgive myself if you left because of me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d like to see a bit more of the world before I retire.
This isn’t the first time I’ve thought of a move, and if you
want to go away, that settles it. I might get a colonial
practice....”</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella thought of some far away country with flat roofs and
dust and a devouring sun, she thought of hundreds of miles
of forest and desert and ocean lying between her and Peter,
and her tears were suddenly dried up as with the hot breath
of that far land. Dry sobs tore her throat, as she clutched
the back of the chair. She pushed her father away—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Go, dear—don’t stay—when I’m like this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He understood her well enough to go.</p>

<p class='c015'>For a few seconds she sobbed on, then checked herself,
and perfunctorily wiped her eyes. The four o’clock sun of
early November was pouring into the room, showing all its
dear faded homeliness, giving life to the memories that filled
it. Long ago Peter had sat in that chair—she had sat on the
arm&#160;... she seemed to feel his warm hand on her cheek as
he held her head down to his shoulder. O Peter, Peter—why
had he left her when he loved her so?... Oh, yes, she
knew he had treated her badly, and had only himself to blame.
But that didn’t make her love him less. She felt now that
she had been in love with him the whole time—all along—all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>through and since their parting. All the time that she thought
she was indifferent, and was happy in her busy life—driving
the car, seeing her friends, talking and writing to Gervase,
cooking and sewing and going to church, wearing pretty
frocks at the winter dances and summer garden-parties—all
that time her love for Peter was still alive, growing and feeding
itself with her life. It had not died and been buried as
she had thought but had entered a second time into its mother’s
womb to be born. She had carried it secretly, as a mother
carries her child in her womb, nourishing it with her life, and
now it was born—born again—with all the strength of the
twice-born.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 2</h3>

<p class='c014'>It would be difficult to say how the rumour got abroad in
Vinehall and Leasan that the Mounts were going away. It
may have been servants’ gossip, or the talk of some doctor
come down to view the practice. But, whatever the source,
the story was in both villages at the end of the month, and
in the first week of December Rose Alard brought it to
Starvecrow.</p>

<p class='c015'>She had come to have tea with Vera, and Peter was there
too. Vera was within three months of the heir, and displayed
her condition with all the opulence of her race. Not even her
purple velvet tea-gown could hide lines reminiscent of Sarah’s
and Hannah’s exulting motherhood. Her very features seemed
to have a more definitely Jewish cast—she was now no longer
just a dark beauty, but a Hebrew beauty, heir of Rebecca
and Rachel and Miriam and Jael. As Jenny had once said,
one expected her to burst into a song about horses and chariots.
She had for the time lost those intellectual and artistic interests
which distinguished her from the other Alards. She no
longer seemed to care about her book, for which she had so
far been unable to find a publisher, but let it lie forgotten in
a drawer, while she worked at baby clothes. Nevertheless she
was inclined to be irritable and snap at Peter, and Peter himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>seemed sullen and without patience. Rose watched him
narrowly—“He’s afraid it’s going to be a girl.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Aloud she said—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you heard that the Mounts are leaving Vinehall?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her news caused all the commotion she could have wished.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The Mounts leaving!”—“When?”—“Why?”—“Both of
them?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, both. I heard it at the Hursts; they seemed quite
positive about it, and you know they’re patients.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But where are they going?” asked Vera.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That I don’t know—yet. The Hursts said something about
a colonial appointment.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m surprised, I must say. Dr. Mount’s getting old, and
you’d think he’d want to stay on here till he retired—not start
afresh in a new place at his age.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you ask me, it’s Miss Stella’s doing. She’s lived here
nearly all her life and hasn’t got a husband, so she thinks
she’ll go and try somewhere else before it’s too late.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then they’d certainly better go to the Colonies—there are
no men left in England. But I’m sorry for Dr. Mount.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I suppose you know it’s all over between her and Gervase?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, is it—at last?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—he hasn’t been there since his holiday in September.
He has his dinner on Sundays either at the Church Farm or
alone with Mr. Luce.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Rose, how do you find out all these things?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The Wades told me this. They say she’s been looking
awful.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter!” cried Vera irritably, as a small occasional table
went to the ground.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No harm done,” he mumbled, picking it up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you’re so clumsy. You’re always knocking things
over....” She checked herself suddenly, pleating angry
folds in her gown.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter got up and went out.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m glad he’s gone,” said Rose—“it’s much easier to talk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>without a man in the room. I really do feel sorry for Stella—losing
her last chance of becoming Lady Alard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You think it’s Gervase who’s cooled off, not she who’s
turned him down?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, she’d never do that. She’s much too keen on getting
married.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, so I thought once. But I’m not so sure now. I used
to think she was in love with Gervase, but now I believe she
only kept him on as a blind.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“To cover what?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mean....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That they’ve been in love with each other the whole time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Vera!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Excitement at the disclosure was mingled in Rose’s voice
with disappointment that she had not been the one to make it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” continued her sister-in-law in a struggling voice—“they’ve
always been in love—ever since he married me—ever
since he gave her up. They’ve never been out of it—I know it
now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I always thought it was all on her side.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, no, it wasn’t. Peter was infatuated with her, for some
strange reason—she doesn’t seem to me at all the sort of
girl a man of his type would take to. Being simple himself,
you’d think he’d like something more sophisticated.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But Stella is sophisticated—she’s artful. Look how she
got Gervase to change his religion, and break his poor brother’s
heart. I often think that it was Gervase’s religion which
killed poor George, and Stella was responsible for that. She
may have pretended to be in love with him just to get him
over. You see she can be forgiven anything she does by just
going to confession.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, she needs forgiveness now if she never did before.
So it’s just as well she knows where to get it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Vera, do you really think there’s anything—I mean
anything wicked between them?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“I don’t know what you call wicked, Rose, if keeping a
man’s affections away from his wife who’s soon going to have
her first child&#160;... if that isn’t enough for you.... No, I
don’t suppose he’s actually slept with her”—Vera liked
shocking Rose—“She hasn’t got the passion or the spunk to go
so far. But it’s bad enough to know Peter’s heart isn’t mine
just when I need him most—to know he only married me
just to put the estate on its legs, and now is bitterly regretting
it”—and Vera began to cry.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But how do you know he’s regretting it? He doesn’t go
about with Stella, I can tell you that. I’d be sure to have
heard if he did.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I daresay he doesn’t go about with her. I shouldn’t
mind if he did, if only his manner was the same to me. But
it isn’t—every time we’re together I can see he doesn’t love
me any more. He may have for a bit—he did, I know—but
Stella got him back, and now every time he looks at me I can
see he’s regretting he ever married me. And if the baby’s a
girl&#160;... my only justification now is that I may be the mother
of an heir&#160;... if the baby’s a girl, I hope I’ll die. Oh, I tell
you, Stella may be Lady Alard yet.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She threw herself back among the cushions and sobbed unrestrainedly.
Rose felt a thrill. She had always looked upon
Vera as a superior being, remote from the commonplaces of
existence in Leasan; and here she was behaving like any other
jealous woman.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I wish I’d never married,” sobbed Vera—“at least
not this sort of marriage. My life’s dull—my husband’s dull—my
only interests are bearing his children and watching his
affair with another woman. I’m sick of the County families—they’ve
got no brains, they’ve got no guts—I’d much better
have married among my own people. They at least are alive.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Rose was shocked. However, she valiantly suppressed her
feelings, and patted the big olive shoulder which had shrugged
abandonedly out of the purple wrappings.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t worry, dear,” she soothed—“you’re upset. I’m sure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Peter’s all right. It’s often rather trying for men in times
like these&#160;...” she heaved on the edge of an indelicate remark&#160;... “so they notice other women more. But I’m quite
sure there’s nothing really wrong between him and Stella; because
if there was,” she added triumphantly, “Stella wouldn’t
be going away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, wouldn’t she!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, of course not. I expect she’s going only because she
knows now definitely that she’ll never get Peter back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It isn’t nonsense, dear. Don’t be so cross.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sorry, Rose, but I’m&#160;... anyhow Dr. Mount can’t
go before I’m through, and that’s three months ahead. I’ve
half a mind not to have him now. I feel sick of the whole
family.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That would be very silly of you, Vera. Dr. Mount’s the
best doctor round here for miles, and it would only be spiting
yourself not to have him. After all he’s not responsible for
Stella’s behaviour.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I suppose not. Oh, I daresay I’m an ass, going on
like this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She sat up, looking more like the author of “Modern
Rhymes.” Rose, who had always been a little afraid of her,
now had the privileged thrill of those who behold the great
in their cheaper moments.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll be all right, dear,” she said meaningly “in three
months’ time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right, or utterly done in. O God, why can’t someone
find out a way of deciding the sex of children? I’d give all
I possess and a bit over to be sure this is going to be a boy.
Not that I want a boy myself—I like girls much better—but
I don’t want to see Peter go off his head or off with Stella
Mount.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t believe she’s got a single chance against you once
you’re yourself again. Even now I could bet anything that it’s
all on her side.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>“She’s got no chance against me as a woman, but as an
Ancient Habit she can probably do a lot with a man like
Peter. But I’m not going to worry about her any more—I’ve
given way and made an utter fool of myself, and it’s
done me good, as it always does. Rose, you promise not to
say a word of this to anyone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course I won’t. But I might try to get at the
facts....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“For God’s sake don’t. You’ll only make a mess.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As she revived she was recovering some old contempt for
her sister-in-law.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 3</h3>

<p class='c014'>The post arrived just as Stella was setting out with the
car one day early the next month to meet her father in Ashford.
He had been in Canterbury for a couple of days, attending
a dinner and some meetings of the Medico-Chirurgical
Society, and this afternoon she was to meet him at Ashford
Station and drive him home. She was in plenty of time, so
when she saw Gervase’s writing on the envelope handed to
her, she went back into the house and opened it.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was now three months since she had spoken to Gervase
or heard anything directly from him. He still came over to
Vinehall on Sundays and to certain early masses in the week,
but he never called at Dr. Mount’s cottage, nor had she seen
him out of church, not heard his voice except in dialogue with
the Priest—“I will go unto the Altar of God”&#160;... “Even
unto the God of my joy and gladness”....</p>

<p class='c015'>She wondered what he could have to say to her now. Perhaps
he had recovered, and was coming back. She would be
pleased, for she missed his company—also it would be good
to have his letters when she was out in Canada.... But
Stella knew what happened to people who “recovered” and
“came back,” and reflected sadly that it would be her duty
to discourage Gervase if he thought himself cured.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the letter did not contain what she expected.</p>

      <div class='line'>“<em>My dear Stella</em>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“I’m writing to tell you something rather funny which has
happened to me. I don’t mean that I’ve fallen out of love
with you—I never shall and don’t want to. But I’m going
to do something with my love which I never expected.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You know that in September, I went ‘into retreat’ for four
days at Thunders Abbey. I was sure I’d hate it—and so I
did in a way—but when I’d got there I saw at once that it
was going to be more important than I’d thought. At first
I thought it was just a dodge of Father Luce’s for making
me uncomfortable—you know he looks upon me as a luxury-loving
young aristocrat, in need of constant mortification. I
don’t know what it was exactly that made me change—it
was partly, I think, the silence, and partly, I know, the
Divine Office. At the end of my visit I knew that Office as
the great work of prayer, and Thunders Abbey as just part
of that heart of prayer which keeps the world alive. And,
dear, I knew that my place was in that heart. I can’t describe
to you exactly what I felt—and I wouldn’t if I could.
But you’re a Catholic, so you won’t think I’m talking nonsense
when I say that I feel I belong there, or, in plainer
language, that I have a vocation. You don’t believe that vocations
come only to priggish maidens and pious youth, but
much more often to ordinary healthy, outdoor people like
you and me. Of course I know that even you will think
(as Father Luce and the Father Superior have thought)
that my vocation may possibly be another name for disappointment
in love. I’ve thought it myself, but I don’t believe
it. Anyhow it’s at last been settled that I’m going to be
allowed to try. As soon as I’ve finished at Gillingham’s I shall
go. You know the Community, of course. It’s an order for
work among the poor, and has houses in London, Birmingham
and Leeds. At Thunders Abbey there’s a big farm for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>drunkards, epileptics, idiots, and other pleasant company.
I’d be useful there, as they’ve just started motor traction, but
I don’t know where they’ll send me. Of course I may
come out again; but I don’t think so. One knows a sure
thing, Stella, and I never felt so sure about anything as about
this—and it’s all the more convincing, because I went in
without a thought of it. I expect you will be tremendously
surprised, but I know you won’t write trying to dissuade me,
and telling me all the good I could do outside by letting out
taxis for hire and things like that. You dear! I feel I
owe everything to you—including this new thing which is
so joyful and so terrifying. For I’m frightened a bit—I’m
not just going in because I like it—I don’t know if I do.
And yet I’m happy.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Don’t say a word to anyone, except your father. I must
wait till the time is ripe to break the news to my family, and
then, I assure you, the excitement will be intense. But I
felt I must write and tell you as soon as I knew definitely
they’d let me come and try, because you are at the bottom of
it all—I don’t mean as a disappointment in love, but as the
friend who first showed me the beauty of this faith which
makes such demands on us. Stella, I’m glad you brought me
to the faith before I’d had time to waste much of myself.
It’s lovely to think that I can give Him all my grown-up
life. I can never pay you back for what you’ve done, but
I can come nearest to it by taking my love for you into this
new life. My love for you isn’t going to die, but it’s going
to become a part of prayer.</p>

<p class='c018'>“May I come and see you next Sunday? I thought I would
write and tell you about things first, for now you know you
won’t feel there are any embarrassments or regrets between
us. Dear Stella, I think of you such a lot, and I’m afraid
you must still be unhappy. But I know that this thing I am
going to do will help you as much as me. Perhaps, too,
some day I shall be a Priest—though I haven’t thought about
that yet—and then I shall be able to help you more. Oh
my dear, it isn’t every man who’s given the power to do so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>much for the woman he loves. I bless you, my dear, and
send you in anticipation one of those free kisses we shall
all give one another in Paradise.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Gervase.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>P.S. There is a rumour that you are going away, but as I
can’t trace its succession back further than Rose, I pronounce
it of doubtful validity.</p>

<p class='c018'>P.P.S. Dear, please burn this—it’s more than a love-letter.</p>

<p class='c018'>P.P.P.S. I hope I haven’t written like a prig.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella let the letter fall into her lap. She was surprised.
Somehow she had never thought of Gervase as a religious;
she had never thought of him except as a keen young engineer—attractive,
self-willed, eccentric, devout. His spiritual development
had been so like hers—and she, as she knew well,
had no vocation to the religious life—that she was surprised
now to find such an essential difference. But her surprise was
glad, for though she brushed aside his words of personal gratitude,
she felt the thrill of her share in the adventure, and a
conviction that it would be for her help as well as for his
happiness. Moreover, this new development took away the
twinges of self-reproach which she could not help feeling
when she thought of her sacrifice of his content to Peter’s
jealousy.</p>

<p class='c015'>But her chief emotion was a kind of sorrowful envy. She
envied Gervase not so much the peace of the cloister—not so
much the definiteness of his choice—as his freedom. He was
free—he had made the ultimate surrender and was free. She
knew that he had now passed beyond her, though she had
had a whole youth of spiritual experience and practice and
he barely a couple of years. He was beyond her, not because
of his vocation, but because of his freedom. His soul had
escaped like a bird from the snare, but hers was still struggling
and bound.</p>

<p class='c015'>She would never feel for Peter as Gervase felt for her.
Her utmost hope was, not to carry her love for him into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>new, purged state, but to forget him—if she aimed at less
she was deceiving herself, forgetting the manner of woman
she was. She had not Gervase’s transmuting ecstasy—nor
could she picture herself giving Peter “free kisses” in a Paradise
where flesh and blood had no inheritance. Her loves
would always be earthly—she would meet her friends in Paradise,
but not her lovers.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 4</h3>

<p class='c014'>Well, there was no time for reflection, either happy or sorrowful—she
must start off for Ashford, or her father would
be kept waiting. Once again, after many times, she experience
the relief of practical action. Her disposition was eminently
practical, and the practical things of love and life and
religion—kisses and meals and sacraments—were to her the
realities of those states. A lover who did not kiss and caress
you, a life which was based on plain living and high thinking,
a religion without good outward forms for its inward graces,
were all things which Stella’s soul would never grasp.</p>

<p class='c015'>So she went out to the little “tenant’s fixture” garage, filled
the Singer’s tank and cranked her up, and drove off comforted
a little in her encounter with life’s surprises. The day was
damp and mild. There was a moist sweetness in the air, and
the scent of ploughed and rain-soaked earth. Already the
spring sowings had begun, and the slow teams moved solemnly
to and fro over the January fields. Surely, thought Stella,
ploughing was the most unhurried toil on earth. The plough
came to the furrow’s end, and halted there, while men and
horses seemed equally deep-sunk in meditation. Whole minutes
later the whip would crack, and the team turn slowly for the
backward furrow. She wouldn’t like to do a slow thing like
that—and yet her heart would ache terribly when it was all
gone, and she would see the great steam ploughs tearing over
the mile-long fields of the West&#160;... she would then think sorrowfully
of those small, old Sussex fields—the oldest in the
world—with their slow ploughing; she would crave all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>more for the inheritance which Peter might have given her
among them....</p>

<p class='c015'>She was beginning to feel bad again—and it was a relief
to find that the car dragged a little on the steering, pulling
towards the hedge, even though she knew that it meant a
punctured tyre. The Singer always punctured her tyres like
a lady—she never indulged in vulgar bursts, with a bang like
a shot-gun and a skid across the road. Stella berthed her beside
the ditch, and began to jack her up.</p>

<p class='c015'>Well, it was a nuisance, seeing that her father would be
kept waiting. But she ought to be able to do the thing in
ten minutes&#160;... she wished she was wearing her old suit,
though. She would make a horrible mess of herself, changing
wheels on a dirty day.... The car was jacked up, and Stella
was laying out her tools on the running board when she heard
a horse’s hoofs in the lane.</p>

<p class='c015'>It seemed at first merely a malignant coincidence that the
rider should be Peter; yet, after all, the coincidence was not
so great when she reflected that she was now on the lane between
Conster and Starvecrow. She had heard that Peter
had lately taken to riding a white horse—it was all part of
the picture he was anxious to paint of himself as Squire. He
would emphasize his Squirehood, since to it he had sacrificed
himself as freeman and lover.</p>

<p class='c015'>She had never seen him looking so much the Squire of
tradition as he looked today. He wore a broadcloth coat,
corduroy breeches, brown boots and leggings and a bowler
hat. Of late he had rather increased in girth, and looked full
his forty years. Unaccountably this fact stirred up Stella’s
heart into a raging pity—Peter middle-aged and getting stout,
Peter pathetically over-acting his part of country gentleman—it
stirred all the love and pity of her heart more deeply than
any figure of romance and youth. She hoped he would not
stop, but considering her position she knew she was hoping
too much.</p>

<p class='c015'>He hitched the white horse to the nearest gate and dismounted.
They had not been alone together since the summer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>though they had met fairly often in company, and now she was
conscious of a profound embarrassment and restraint in them
both.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you punctured?” he asked heavily.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, but the tyre has,” said Stella.</p>

<p class='c015'>The reply was not like herself, it was part of the new attitude
of defence—a poor defence, since she despised herself
for being on guard, and was therefore weaker.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You must let me help you change the wheel.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can do it myself, quite easily. Don’t bother, Peter—you
know I’m used to these things.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, but it’s dirty work for a woman. You’ll spoil your
clothes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She could not insist on refusing. She went to the other
side of the car, where her spare wheel was fastened, and bent
desperately over the straps. She wondered how the next few
minutes would pass—in heaviness and pertness as they had
begun, or in technical talk of tyres and nuts and jacks, or in
the limp politeness of the knight errant and distressed lady.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next moment Peter made a variation she had not expected.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella, is it true that you’re going away?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I—I don’t know. It isn’t settled.... Who told you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Rose told me—but it can’t be true.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your father surely would never go away at his time of
life—and Rose spoke of the Colonies. He’d never go right
away and start afresh like that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Father’s heard of a very good billet near Montreal. We
haven’t settled anything yet, but we both feel we’d like a
change.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, why shouldn’t we? We’ve been here more than
twenty years, and as for Father being old, he’s not too old to
want to see a bit more of the world.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter said nothing. He was taking off the wheel. When
he had laid it against the bank he turned once more to Stella.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“It’s queer how I always manage to hear gossip about you.
But it seems that this time I’m right, while last time I was
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Everyone gets talked about in a little place like this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She tried to speak lightly, but she was distressed by the
way he looked at her. Those pale blue eyes&#160;... Alard eyes,
Saxon eyes&#160;... the eyes of the Old People looking at her
out of the Old Country, and saying “Don’t go away....”</p>

<p class='c015'>The next minute his lips repeated what his eyes had said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t go away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She trembled, and stepped back from him on the road.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I must go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Indeed you mustn’t—I can’t bear it any longer if you do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s why I must go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—no——”</p>

<p class='c015'>He came towards her, and she stepped back further still.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t go, Stella. I can’t live here without you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Peter, you must. What good am I doing you here?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re here. I know that you’re only a few miles away.
I can think of you as near me. If you went right away....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It would be much better for both of us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, it wouldn’t. Stella, it will break me if you go. My
only comfort during the last six hellish months has been that
at least you’re not so very far from me in space, that I can see
you, meet you, talk to you now and then....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Peter, that’s what I can’t bear. That’s why I’m going
away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her voice was small and thin with agitation. This was
worse, a hundred times worse, than anything she had dreaded
five minutes ago. She prayed incoherently for strength and
sense.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If that’s what you feel, you’ve got to stay,” Peter was
saying. “Stella, you’ve shown me—Stella, you still care....
Oh, I’ll own up, I’ll own that I’ve been a fool, and a blackguard
to you. But if you still care, I can be almost happy.
We’ve still something left. Only you’ll have to stay.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mustn’t talk like this.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>“Why not—if you still care? Oh, Stella, say it’s true—say
you still care&#160;... a little.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She could not deny her love, even though she was more
afraid of his terrible happiness than she had been before of
his despair. To deny it would be a profaning of something
holier than truth. All she could say was—</p>

<p class='c015'>“If I love you, it’s all the more necessary for me to go
away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s not. If you love me, I can be to you at least what you
are to me. But if you go away, you’ll be as wretched as I shall
be without you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No&#160;... if I go away, we can forget.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Forget!—What?—each other?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The word was almost inaudible. She prayed with all her
strength that Peter would not come to her across the road and
take her in his arms. His words she could fight, but not his
arms....</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella—you’re not telling me that you’re going away to
forget me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I must, Peter. And you’ll forget me, too. Then we’ll be
able to live instead of just—loving.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But my love for you is my life—all the life I’ve got.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—you’ve got Vera, and soon you’ll have your child.
When I’ve gone you can go back to them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t—you don’t know what you’re talking about. If you
think I can ever feel again for Vera what I felt when I was
fool enough——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, don’t....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I will. Why should you delude yourself, and think I’m
just being unfaithful to my wife? It’s to you I’ve been unfaithful.
I was unfaithful to you with Vera—and now I’ve
repented and come back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They faced each other, two yards apart in the little muddy
lane. Behind Peter the three-wheeled car stood forlornly surrounded
by tools, while his horse munched the long soaking
tufts under the hedge. Behind Stella the hedge rose abruptly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>in a soaring crown. Looking up suddenly, she saw the delicate
twigs shining against a sheet of pale blue sky in a faint sunlight.
For some reason they linked themselves with her mind’s
effort and her heart’s desire. Here was beauty which did not
burn.... She suddenly found herself calm.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter, dear, there’s no good talking like that. Let’s be
sensible. Rightly or wrongly you’ve married someone else, and
you’ve got to stand by it and so have I. If I stay on here we
will only just be miserable—always hankering after each other,
and striving for little bits of each other which can’t satisfy.
Neither of us will be able to settle down and live an ordinary
life, and after all that’s what we’re here for—not for adventures
and big passions, but just to live ordinary lives and be
happy in an ordinary way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, damn you!” cried Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was like the old times when he used to rail against her
“sense,” against the way she always insisted that their love
should be no star or cloud, but a tree, well rooted in the earth.
It made it more difficult for her to go on, but she persevered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ve tried the other thing, Peter—you’ve tried sacrificing
ordinary things like love and marriage to things like family
pride and the love of a place. You’ve found it hasn’t worked,
so don’t do the whole thing over again by sacrificing your home
and family to a love which can never be satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But it can be,” said Peter—“at least it could if you were
human.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella, a little to his annoyance, didn’t pretend not to know
what he meant.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, it couldn’t be—not satisfied. We could only satisfy a
part of it—the desire part—the part which wants home and
children would always have to go unsatisfied, and that’s as
strong as the rest, though it makes less fuss.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And how much satisfaction shall we get through never
seeing each other again?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We shall get it—elsewhere. You will at least be free to
go back to Vera—and you did love her once, you can’t deny it—you
did love her once. And I——”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“—Will be free to marry another man.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t say that, Peter—though also I don’t say that I
won’t. But I shall be free to live the life of a normal human
being again, which I can’t now. I shan’t be bringing unrest
and misery wherever I go—to myself and to you. Oh, Peter,
I know we can save ourselves if we stop now, stop in time.
We were both quite happy last time I was away—I was a fool
ever to come back. I must go away now before it’s too late.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re utterly wrong. When you first went away I could
be happy with Vera—I couldn’t now. All that’s over and done
with for ever, I tell you. I can never go back to her, whether
you go or stay. It’s nothing to do with your coming back—it’s
her fault—and mine. We aren’t suited, and nothing can
ever bring us together again now we’ve found it out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not even the child?...”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—not even that. Besides, how do I know.... Stella,
all the things I’ve sacrificed you to have failed me, except
Starvecrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ve still got Starvecrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, but I.... Oh, Stella, don’t leave me alone, not even
with Starvecrow. The place wants you, and when you’re gone
I’m afraid.... Vera doesn’t belong there; it’s your place.
Oh, Stella, don’t say you can live without me, any more than
I can live without you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She longed to give him the answer of her heart—that she
could never, never live without him, go without the dear privilege
of seeing him, of speaking to him, of sacrificing to him all
other thoughts and loves. But she forced herself to give him
the answer of her head, for she knew that it would still be true
when her heart had ceased to choke her with its beating.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter, I don’t <em>feel</em> as if I could live without you, but I <em>know</em>
I can—and I know you can live without me, if I go away.
What you’ve said only shows me more clearly that I must go.
I could never stop here now you know I love you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And why not?—it’s your damned religion, I suppose—teaching
you that it’s wrong to love—that all that sort of thing’s
disgusting, unspiritual—you’ve got your head stuffed with all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>the muck a lot of celibate priests put into it, who think everything’s
degrading.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She felt the tears come into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t, my dear. Do you really believe—you who’ve known
me—that I think love is degrading?—or that my religion
teaches me to think so? Why, it’s because all that is so lovely,
so heavenly and so good, that it mustn’t be spoilt—by secrecy
and lies, by being torn and divided. Oh, Peter, you know I
love love....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So much that you can apparently shower it on anyone as
long as you get the first victim out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They both turned suddenly, as the jar of wheels sounded
up the hill. It would be agony to have the discussion broken
off here, but Stella knew that she mustn’t refuse any opportunity
of ending it. No longer afraid of Peter’s arms, she
crossed swiftly to the dismantled car.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Please don’t wait. I can manage perfectly now. Please
go, Peter—please go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll go only if you promise to see me again before you
leave.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course I will—I’ll see you again; but you must go now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The wagon of Barline, heavy with crimson roots, was lurching
and skidding down the hill towards them. Peter went to
his standing horse, and rode him off into the field. Stella
turned to the car, and, crouched in its shelter, allowed herself
the luxury of tears.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 5</h3>

<p class='c014'>She dried her eyes, came up from behind the car, and lost
herself in the sheer labour of putting on the wheel. She was
late, she must hurry; she strove, she sweated, and at last was
once more in her seat, the damaged wheel strapped in its place,
all the litter of tools in the dickie. She switched on the engine,
pressed the self-starter pedal, slid the gear lever into place, and
the little car ran forward. Then she realised what a relief it
was to find herself in motion—some weight seemed to lift from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>her mind, and her numb thoughts began to move, to run to and
fro. She was alive again.</p>

<p class='c015'>But it hurt to be alive. Perhaps one was happier dead.
For the thoughts that ran to and fro were in conflict, they
formed themselves into two charging armies, meeting with
horrible impact, terror and wounds. Her mind was a battle-field,
divided against itself, and as usual the movement of the
car seemed to make her thoughts more independent, more free
of her control. They moved to the throb and mutter of the
engine, as to some barbaric battle-music, some monotonous
drum. She herself seemed to grow more and more detached
from them. She was no longer herself—she was two selves—the
self that loved Peter and the self that loved God. She was
Stella Mount at prayer in Vinehall church—Stella Mount
curled up on Peter’s knees&#160;... long ago, at Starvecrow—Stella
Mount receiving her soul again in absolution&#160;... Stella
Mount loving, loving, with a heart full of fiery sweetness....
Well, aren’t they a part of the same thing—love of man and
love of God? Yes, they are—but today there is schism in the
body.</p>

<p class='c015'>During the last few months love had given her nothing but
pain, for she had seemed to be swallowed up in it, away from
the true richness of life. She had lost that calm, cheerful glow
in which all things, even the dullest and most indifferent, had
seemed interesting and worth while. Love had extinguished it.
The difference she saw between religion and love was that
religion shone through all things with a warm, soft light,
making them all friendly and sweet, whereas love was like a
fierce beam concentrated on one spot, leaving the rest of life
in darkness, shining only on one object, and that so blindingly
that it could not be borne.</p>

<p class='c015'>She felt a sudden spasm of revolt against the choice forced
upon her. Why should she have to choose between heaven
and earth, which she knew in her heart were two parts of one
completeness? Why should God want her to give up for His
sake the loveliest thing that He had made?... Why should
He want her to <em>burn</em>?</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Now had come the time, she supposed, when she would have
to pay for the faith which till then had been all joy, which in
its warmth and definiteness had taught her almost too well
how to love. It had made her more receptive, more warm,
more eager, and had deprived her of those weapons of self-interest
and pride and resentment which might have armed
her now. Perhaps it was because they knew religion makes
such good lovers that masters of the spiritual life have urged
that the temptations of love are the only ones from which it is
allowable to run away. It was her duty to run away from
Peter now, because the only weapons with which she could
fight him were more unworthy than surrender. With a grimmer,
vaguer belief she might have escaped more easily—she
might have seen evil in love, she might have distrusted happiness
and shunned the flesh. But then she would not have been
Stella Mount—she owed her very personality to her faith—she
owed it all the intense joy she had had in human things.
Should she stumble at the price?</p>

<p class='c015'>If only the price were not Peter—Peter whom she loved,
whom the love of God had taught her to love more than her
heart could ever have compassed alone. Why must he be
sacrificed? After all, she was offering him up to her own
satisfaction—to her anxiety to keep hold of heavenly things.
Why should he be butchered to give her soul a holiday?
She almost hated herself—hated herself for her odious sense,
for her cold-blooded practicalness. She proposed to go away
not only so as to be out of temptation—let her be honest—but
so that she could forget him and live the life of a normal
happy woman&#160;... which of course meant some other man....
No wonder he was disgusted with her—poor, honest,
simple, unsatisfied Peter. She was proposing to desert him,
sure of interior comforts he had never known, and secretly
sure that the detestable adaptability of her nature would not
allow her to mourn him long once he was far away. Oh,
Peter—Peter!... “I will give you back the years that the
locust hath eaten—I have it in my power. I can do it—I can
give you back the locust’s years. I can do it still....”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>She could do it still. She could tell her father that she did
not want to go away after all—and he would be glad&#160;... poor
Father! He was only going for her sake. He would be glad
to stay on among the places and the people that he loved. And
she&#160;... she could be a good, trusty friend to Peter, someone
he could turn to in his loneliness, who would understand and
help him with his plans for Alard and Starvecrow.... What
nonsense she was talking. Silly hypocrite! Both sides of her,
the Stella who loved Peter and the Stella who loved God, saw
the futility of such an idea. She could never be any man’s
friend—least of all Peter’s. If she stayed, it would be to love
Peter, to be all that it was still possible for her to be to him,
all that Vera was and the more that she was not.</p>

<p class='c015'>But could she? Had she the power to love Peter with a love
unspoilt by regret? Would she be able to bear the thought of
her treachery to the Lord whose happy child she had been so
long?—to His Mother and hers—to all His friends and hers,
the saints—to all the great company of two worlds whom she
would betray? For her the struggle contained no moral issue.
It was simply a conflict between love and love. And all the
while she knew in the depth of her heart that love cannot
really be divided, and that her love of God held and sustained
her love of Peter, as the cloud holds the rain-drop, and the
shore the grain of sand.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first houses of Ashford slid past, and she saw the many
roofs of the railway-works. Traffic dislocated the strivings of
her mind, and in time her thoughts once more became numb.
They lay like the dead on the battle-field, the dead who would
rise again.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 6</h3>

<p class='c014'>Gervase came to see Stella, according to promise, the following
Sunday. He found her looking tired and heavy-headed,
and able only mechanically to sustain her interest in his plans.
Also he still found her unapproachable—she was not cold or
contrary, but reserved, feeding on herself.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>He guessed the source of her trouble, but shrank from
probing it—keeping the conversation to his own affairs with
an egotism he would normally have been ashamed of. What
he noticed most was the extinction of joy in her—she had
always seemed to him so fundamentally happy, and it was her
profound and so natural happiness which had first attracted
him towards her religion. But now the lamp was out. He
was not afraid for her—it did not strike him that she
could possibly fail or drop under her burden; but his heart
ached for her, alone in the Dark Night—that very Dark Night
he himself had come through alone.... Now he stood, also
alone, in a strange dawn which had somehow changed the
world, as the fields are changed in the whiteness of a new
day.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was not till he got up to go that he dared try to come
closer. They had been talking about the difficulties of the life
he had chosen.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m afraid Christianity’s a hard faith, my dear,” he said as
he took her hand—“the closer you get to the Gospel the harder
it is. You’ve no idea what a shock the Gospels gave me when
I read them again last year, not having looked at them since I
was a kid. I was expecting something rather meek-and-mild,
with a gentle, womanly Saviour, and all sorts of kind and good-natured
sentiments. Instead of which I find that the Kingdom
of Heaven is for the violent, while the Lion of Judah roars in
the Temple courts&#160;... He built His Church upon a Rock, and
sometimes we hit that Rock mighty hard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I do hope you’ll be happy, Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sure of that, though whether it will be in a way that
will be easily recognised as happiness I’m not so sure.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“When are you going?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s not quite settled yet. I leave off at Gillingham’s on
the twenty-fifth, and I expect I’ll go to Thunders early in
February. I’ll come and see you again before then. Goodbye,
my dear.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He kissed her hand before letting it go.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ 7</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>He had said nothing to her about his sister Jenny, though
her marriage was so close as to seem almost more critical than
his own departure. He felt the unfairness of sharing with
Stella so difficult a secret, also he realised that the smaller the
circle to which it was confined the smaller the catastrophe when
it was either accidentally discovered or deliberately revealed.</p>

<p class='c015'>About a week before the day actually fixed for the wedding,
the former seemed more likely. Jenny met Gervase on his
return from Ashford with a pale, disconcerted face.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Father guesses something’s up,” she said briefly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What?—How?—Has anyone told him?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—he doesn’t really know anything, thank heaven—at
least anything vital. But he’s heard I was at tea at Fourhouses
twice last week. One of the Dengates called for some
eggs, I remember, and she must have told Rose when Rose
was messing about in the village. He’s being heavily sarcastic,
and asking me if I wouldn’t like Mrs. Appleby asked in to tea,
so that I won’t have to walk so far to gratify my democratic
tastes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But Peter’s had tea with them, too—you told me it was he
who introduced you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, but that only makes it worse. Peter’s been at me as
well—says he’d never have taken me there if he’d thought I
hadn’t a better sense of my position. He was very solemn
about it, poor old Peter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But of course they don’t suspect any reason.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, but I’m afraid they will. I’m not likely to have gone
there without some motive—twice, too—and, you see, I’ve been
so secret about it, never mentioned it at home, as I should have
done if I’d had tea at Glasseye or Monkings or anywhere like
that. They must think I’ve some reason for keeping quiet....
I hope they won’t question me, for I’m a bad liar.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll be married in ten days—I don’t suppose they’ll get
really suspicious before that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>However, a certain amount of reflection made him uneasy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>and after dinner he drove over to Fourhouses, to discuss the
matter with Ben Godfrey himself.</p>

<p class='c015'>When he came back, he went straight up to Jenny’s room—she
had gone to bed early, so as to give her family less time for
asking questions.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, my dear,” he said when she let him in, “I’ve talked it
over with Ben, and we both think that you’ll have to get
married at once.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“At once!—But can we?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—the law allows you to get married the day after tomorrow.
It’ll cost thirty pounds, but Fourhouses can rise to
that, and it’s much better to get the thing over before it’s found
out. Not that anyone could stop you, but it would be a maddening
business if they tried, and anyhow I think the parents
will take it easier if it’s too late to do anything.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think you’re quite right—absolutely right. But——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But what?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, nothing—only it seems such a jump, now I’m standing
right on the edge.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re not afraid, Jenny?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—only in the way that everyone’s afraid of a big thing.
But you’re absolutely right. Now there’s a chance of us being
found out, we must act at once. I don’t want to have to tell
any lies about Ben. I suppose he’ll go up to town tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, and you and I will follow him the day after. I must
see about a day off. I’m not quite clear as to what one does
exactly to get a special license, but he’ll go to the Court of
Faculties and they’ll show him how. He’s going to wire me
at Gillingham’s—lucky I’m still there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t envy you, Gervase, having to break the news to
Father and Mother.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I don’t think it’ll be much fun. But really it will be
better than if you wrote—I can let them down more gently, and
they won’t feel quite so outraged. As for the row—there’ll
be one about my own little plan in a short time, so I may as
well get used to them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny said nothing. She had known of Gervase’s “little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>plan” only for the last week, and she had for it all the dread
and dislike which the active Englishwoman instinctively feels
for the contemplative and supernatural—reinforced now by
the happy lover’s desire to see all the world in love. The
thought of her brother, with all his eager experimental joy in
life, all his profound yet untried capacity for love, taking vows
of poverty and celibacy, filled her with grief and indignation—she
felt that he was being driven by the backwash of his disappointment
over Stella Mount, and blamed “those Priests,”
who she felt had unduly influenced him at a critical time.
However, after her first passionate protest, she had made no
effort to oppose him, feeling that she owed him at least silence
for all that he had done to help her in her own adventure, and
trusting to time and recovery to show him his folly. She was
a little reassured by the knowledge that he could not take his
final vows for many years to come.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was aware of this one constraint between them, and
coming over to her as she lay in bed, he gave her a kiss. For
some unfathomable reason it stung her, and turning over on
her side she burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jenny, Jenny darling—don’t cry. Oh, why&#160;... Jenny, if
you’ve any doubts, tell me before it’s too late, and I’ll help you
out—I promise. Anything rather than....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, don’t, Gervase. It isn’t that. Can’t you understand?
It’s—oh, I suppose all women feel like this—not big enough&#160;... afraid....”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 8</h3>

<p class='c014'>The wedding had always been planned to take place in
London, so it was merely the time that was being altered.
Both Gervase and Jenny had seen, and Ben Godfrey had been
brought reluctantly to see, that to be married at home would
double the risks; so a room had been taken and a bag of Godfrey’s
clothes deposited in a Paddington parish, where the
Vicar was liberal in his interpretation of the laws of residence,
and an ordinary licence procured. The change of plans necessitated
a special licence, and Jenny had to wait till Gervase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>came home the next evening to know if all was in order.
However, after the shock of its inception, the new scheme
worked smoothly. Jenny came down early the next morning
and breakfasted with Gervase, then drove off in Henry Ford,
leaving a message with Wills that she had gone to London for
the day, and her brother was driving her as far as Ashford.</p>

<p class='c015'>Everything was so quiet and matter-of-fact as to seem to her
almost normal—she could not quite realise that she had left
her old life behind her at Conster, even more completely than
most brides leaving their father’s house; that ahead of her was
not only all the difference between single and married, but all
the difference between Alard and Godfrey, Conster and Fourhouses.
She was not only leaving her home, but her class,
her customs, her acquaintance. It was not till she was standing
beside Godfrey in a strange, dark church, before a strange
clergyman, that she realised the full strangeness of it all. For
a moment her head swam with terror—she found herself full
of a desperate longing to wake up in her bed at Conster and
find it was a dream—she thought of the catastrophe of Mary’s
marriage, and she knew that she was taking far bigger risks
than Mary.... And through all this turmoil she could hear
herself saying quite calmly—“I, Janet Christine, take thee,
Benjamin, to be my wedded husband.” Some mechanical part
of her was going on with the business, while her emotions
cowered and swooned. Now she was signing her name in the
register—Janet Christine Godfrey—now she was shaking hands
with the clergyman and answering his inane remarks with
inanities of her own. It was too late to draw back—she had
plunged—Jenny Alard was dead.</p>

<p class='c015'>They had lunch at a restaurant in Praed Street, and afterwards
Gervase went with them to Paddington Station and saw
them off to Cornwall. They were not going to be away long,
partly on account of Godfrey’s spring sowings, and partly
because Jenny felt that she could not leave her brother any
length of time to stand the racket. She would still have liked
to suppress his share in the business, but Gervase was firm—“It’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>treating them better,” he said, “and, besides, it will help
them a lot to have a scapegoat on the premises.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny felt almost sentimental in parting from the little
brother, who had helped her so much in the path she had
chosen, and who had taken for himself so rough and ridiculous
a road. She kissed him in the carriage doorway, made him
promise to write to her, and then did her best to put him out
of her head for the first happy hours of the honeymoon.</p>

<p class='c015'>Circumstances made this fairly easy. By the time they were
at Mullion, watching the low lamps of the stars hanging over
the violet mists that veiled Poldhu, even Gervase seemed very
far away, and the household and life of Conster Manor almost
as if they had never been. Nothing was real but herself and
Ben, alone together in the midst of life, each most completely
the other’s desire and possession. When she looked into his
eyes, full of their new joy and trouble, the husband’s eyes
which held also the tenderness of the father and the simplicity
of the child, there was no longer any past or future, but only
the present—“I love.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The next day, however, recalled her rather abruptly to
thoughts of her scapegoat. She received a telegram—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Father kicked me out address Church Cottage Vinehall
don’t worry Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny was conscience-stricken, though she knew that Gervase
would not be much hurt by his exile. But she was
anxious to hear what had happened, and waited restlessly for
a letter. None came, but the next morning another telegram.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Father had stroke please come home Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So Jenny Godfrey packed up her things and came home after
two days’ honeymoon. Happiness is supposed to make time
short, but those two days had seemed like twenty years.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ 9</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Gervase reproached himself for having done his part of the
business badly, though he never felt quite sure how exactly he
had blundered. He had reached Conster two hours before
dinner, and trusted that this phenomenon might prepare his
father for some surprise. But, disappointingly, Sir John did
not notice his return—he had grown lately to think less and
less about his youngest son, who was seldom at home and
whom he looked upon as an outsider. Gervase had deliberately
alienated himself from Alard, and Sir John could never,
in spite of Peter’s efforts, be brought properly to consider him
as an heir. His goings out and his comings in were of little
consequence to the head of the house. So when at six o’clock
Gervase came into the study, his father was quite unimpressed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“May I speak to you for a minute, Sir?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, well—what is it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir John dipped <cite>Country Life</cite> the fraction of an inch to
imply a temporary hearing.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s about Jenny, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, what about her?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’s—I’ve been with her in town today. I’ve just come
back. She asked me to tell you about her and young Godfrey.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What’s that? Speak up, Sir, can’t you? I can’t hear when
you mumble. Come and stand where I can see you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase came and stood on the hearthrug. He was beginning
to feel nervous. Uncomfortable memories of childhood
rushed up confusedly from the back of his mind, and gave him
sore feelings of helplessness and inferiority.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s about Jenny and young Godfrey, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Godfrey! Who’s Godfrey?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Benjamin Godfrey of Fourhouses—the man who bought
your Snailham land.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, what about him?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s about him and Jenny, Sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, <em>what</em> about ’em? What the devil’s he got to do with
Jenny?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“Don’t you remember she went to tea at Fourhouses last
week?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She hasn’t been there again, has she?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase considered that the subject had been sufficiently led
up to—anyhow he could stand no more of the preliminaries.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, yes, Sir—at least she’s having tea with him now—at
least not tea.... I mean, they were married this morning.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir John dropped <cite>Country Life</cite>.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Married this morning,” he repeated in a lame, normal voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, Sir, at St. Ethelburga’s, Paddington. They’ve been in
love with each other for some time, but as they didn’t expect
you’d quite see things as they did, they thought they’d better
wait to tell you till after the ceremony.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And where—where are they now?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“At Mullion, Sir—in Cornwall.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir John said nothing. His face turned grey, and he
trembled. Gervase was distressed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t take it so dreadfully to heart, Father. I’m sure it’s
really for the best. He’s a decent chap, and very well-to-do—he’ll
be able to give her everything she’s been accustomed to”—remembering
an old tag.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Get out!” said Sir John suddenly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m frightfully sorry if you think we’ve treated you badly,
Sir. But really we tried to do it in the way we thought would
hurt you least.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Get out!” repeated his father—“get out of here. This is
your doing, with your socialism, with your contempt for your
own family, with your.... Get out of the room, or I’ll....”</p>

<p class='c015'>His shaking hand groped round for a missile, and Gervase
moved hastily to the door, too late, however, to escape a bound
volume of <cite>Punch</cite>, which preceded him into the hall.</p>

<p class='c015'>Wills was standing outside the dining-room door with a tray,
and Gervase found it very difficult to look dignified. Such an
attitude was even more difficult to keep up during the alarms
that followed. He retreated to his bedroom, taking <cite>Punch</cite> with
him, partly as a solace, partly in a feeble hope of persuading
Wills that to have a book thrown at your head is a normal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>way of borrowing it. He had not been alone a quarter of an
hour before he was summoned by Speller, his mother’s maid.
There followed an interview which began in reproaches, passed
on to an enquiry into Jenny’s luggage—had she bought brushes
and sponges in London, since she had taken nothing away?—and
ended cloudily in hysterics and lavender water. Gervase
went back to his room, which ten minutes later was entered by
the sobbing Doris, who informed him he had “killed Mother,”
who apparently required a post-mortem interview. Once again
he went down to the boudoir with its rose-coloured lights and
heavy scents of restoratives, and to the jerky accompaniment
of Doris’s weeping told his story over again. He had to tell
it a fourth time to Peter, who had been summoned from Starvecrow,
and found that it was hardening into set phrases, and
sounded rather like the patter of a guide recounting some
historic elopement from a great house.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’ve been in love for some time, but as they didn’t
expect you’d quite see things as they did——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My God!” said Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was perhaps the most scandalised of all the Alards, and
had about him a solemn air of wounding which was more
distressing to Gervase than his father’s wrath.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I introduced him to her,” he said heavily—“I introduced
him. I never thought&#160;... how <em>could</em> I think&#160;... that she
held herself so cheap—all of us so cheap.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You really needn’t treat the matter as if Jenny had married
the rag-and-bone man——” began Gervase.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know Godfrey’s position quite well.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He farms his own land, and comes of good old stock. He’s
well off, and will be able to give her everything she’s been
accustomed to——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He won’t. She’s been accustomed to the society of gentlepeople,
and he’ll never be able to give her that. She’s gone to
live on a farm, where she’ll have her meals in the kitchen with
the farm-men. I tell you I know the Godfreys, and they’re
nothing more than a respectable, good sort of farming people
who’ve done well out of the war. At least, I won’t call them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>even that now,” he added fiercely—“I won’t call a man respectable
who worms himself into intimacy with my sister on
the strength of my having introduced him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“However, it’s some comfort to think they’ve gone to the
Poldhu hotel at Mullion,” said Lady Alard; “the Blakelocks
were there once, you know, Doris, and the Reggie Mulcasters.
She won’t notice the difference quite so terribly since he’s taken
her there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, she will,” said Peter—“she’ll notice the difference between
the kind of man she’s been used to meeting here and a
working farmer, who wasn’t even an officer during the war.
If she doesn’t—I’ll think worse of her even than I do now.
And as for you——” turning suddenly on Gervase—“I don’t
trust myself to tell you what I think of you. I expect you’re
pleased that we’ve suffered this disgrace—that a lady of our
house has married into the peasantry. You think it’s democratic
and all that. You’re glad—don’t say you’re not.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I am glad, because Jenny’s happy. You, none of you,
seem to think of that. You don’t seem to think that ‘the kind
of man she’s been meeting here’ hasn’t been the slightest use
to her—that all he’s done has been to trouble her and trifle
with her and then go off and marry money—that now at last
she’s met a man who’s treated her honourably——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Honourably! He’s treated her like the adventurer he is.
Oh, it’s a fine thing of him to marry into our family, even if
she hasn’t got a penny—his ancestors were our serfs—they ran
at our people’s stirrups, and our men had the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droit du seigneur</span></i>
of their women——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And pulled out the teeth of your wife’s forefathers,” said
Gervase, losing his temper. “If you’re going back five hundred
years, I don’t think your own marriage will bear the test.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He knew that if he stayed he would quarrel with them all,
and he did not want to do that, for he was really sorry for
them, wounded in their most sensitive feelings of family pride.
He walked out of the room, and made for the attic stairs,
seeking the rest and dignity of solitude. But it was not to be.
The door of his father’s dressing-room opened as he passed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>and Sir John came out on the landing, already dressed for
dinner.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You understand that after what has happened I cannot
keep you here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He was quite calm now, and rather terrifying.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I—oh, no—I mean yes, of course,” stammered Gervase.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You have work at Ashford, so you can go and lodge near
it. Or you can go to your Ritualist friends at Vinehall. I
refuse to have you here after your treachery. You are a
traitor, Sir—to your own family.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“When—when would you like me to go?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You can stay till tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thanks—I’ll leave tonight.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So the day’s catastrophe ended in Gervase driving off
through the darkness in Henry Ford, his suit-case and a few
parcels of books behind him. He had decided to go to Luce—the
Priest would take him in till he was able to go to Thunders
Abbey.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, anyhow, I’m spared that other row,” he thought to
himself; “or, rather, I’ve got through two rows in one.
Father won’t mind what I do with myself after this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He felt rather forlorn as the lorry’s lights swept up the
Vinehall road. During the last few months he had been
stripped of so many things—his devotion to Stella, his comradeship
with Jenny—he knew that he could never be to her
what he had been before she married—and now his family and
his home. And all he had to look forward to was a further,
more complete stripping, even of the clothes he wore, so that
in all the world he would own nothing.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 10</h3>

<p class='c014'>Any lack of cordiality in Luce’s welcome was made up by
his quite matter-of-fact acceptance of this sudden descent upon
him at a late hour of a young man and all his worldly goods,
including a Ford lorry. The latter was given the inn stable
as a refuge, while Gervase was told he could have the spare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>bedroom as long as he liked if he would clear out the apples.
This done and some porridge eaten, he went to bed, utterly
worn out, and feeling less like Gervase Alard than he had ever
felt in his life.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next day he went off to work as usual, sending a telegram
to Jenny on his way. When he came back he found a
message had arrived from Conster—he must go home at once;
his father had had a stroke.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve a ghastly feeling it was brought on by this row,” he
said to Luce, as he filled up the lorry’s tank for the new
journey.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It must have been,” was all the reassurance he got.</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase felt wretched enough. The message, which had
been left by Dr. Mount, gave no details, and as the cottage was
empty when he called, there had been no verbal additions or
explanations. He thought of calling at the doctor’s on his way
to Leasan—he had meant to go there anyhow this evening and
tell them about Jenny’s marriage—but he decided it was best
to lose no time, and drove straight to Conster.</p>

<p class='c015'>Here he received his first respite. The stroke was not a
severe one, and Dr. Mount was practically certain Sir John
would get over it. However, he seemed to think the other
members of the family ought to be sent for, and Doris had
telegraphed to Mary but not to Jenny, as she didn’t think Jenny
deserved it after what she had done. She did not think Gervase
deserved it, either, but evidently Dr. Mount had taken it
upon himself to decide, and left a message without consulting
her.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was not allowed to go near his father that night, and
spent the hours intermittently sleeping and waking in his little
cold bedroom, now empty of everything that was really his.
The next morning he went out and sent a telegram to Jenny.
But by the time she arrived her presence was useless. Sir
John had recovered consciousness and would see none of his
erring children. Mary, Gervase and Jenny waited together in
the drawing-room in hopes that the edict would be revoked.
But, as Doris came down to tell them at intervals, it was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>use whatever. He refused to let them come near him—indeed,
the mere mention of their names seemed to irritate him
dangerously. Towards evening Dr. Mount advised them to
go away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m afraid there’s no hope, at present anyhow—and it’s best
not to worry him. There’s often a very great irritability in
these cases. He may become calmer as his condition improves.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So Jenny, scared and tired, was taken away by her husband
to the shelter of Fourhouses, and Gervase prepared to go back
to Vinehall. They were both rather guiltily conscious that
they did not pity those who had been denied the presence so
much as those who were bound to it—Doris, who as unofficial
nurse and substitute scapegoat, was already beginning to show
signs of wear and tear—and Peter, worn with a growing sense
of responsibility and the uncertain future brought a step nearer&#160;... no doubt the younger ones had made an easy escape.</p>

<p class='c015'>Only Mary looked a bit wistful.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s so long since I’ve seen him,” she said as she stood on
the steps, waiting for the car which was to take her back to
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Cheer up, my dear—he’ll change his mind when he gets
better,” said Gervase.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary shook her head. She had altered strikingly since he
had seen her last. She seemed all clothes—faultless, beautiful
clothes, which seemed mysteriously a part of herself so that it
was difficult to imagine her without them. Her real self had
shrunk, faded, become something like a whisper or a ghost—she
was less Mary Pembroke than a suit of lovely grey velvet
and fur which had somehow come alive and taken the simulacrum
of a woman to show off its beauty.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where are you going?” he asked her, moved with a sudden
anxious pity.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Back to Hastings. I’ve found a very comfortable small
hotel, and I think I’ll stay there till I know more how things
are going with Father. I expect I shall run over and see
Jenny now and then.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m glad you’re going to do that,” he cried warmly—“it’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>mean a lot to her to have one of the family with her—especially
when I’m gone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You?—where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c015'>He found himself quite unable to tell her of what he was
looking forward to.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, my work at Ashford comes to an end in a week, and
I’ll have to pack off somewhere else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He kissed her before she went away, and found an unexpected
warmth in her lips. After all, the real Mary had
always lived very far beneath the surface, and as years went
by and the surface had become more and more ravaged she
had retreated deeper and deeper down. But he was glad to
think that at the bottom, and perhaps by queer, perverse means,
she had somehow managed to keep herself alive.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 11</h3>

<p class='c014'>Jenny’s sudden return had the disadvantage of bringing her
back into the midst of her family while the scandal of her
marriage was still hot. As her father refused to see her, Ben
had suggested taking her away again, but Jenny did not like
to leave while Sir John was still in any danger, and by the
time all danger was past, her husband’s affairs had once more
fast bound him to the farm—besides, the various members of
her family had adjusted themselves to her defection, and
settled down either into hostility or championship, according
to their own status in the tribe.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was characteristic of the house of Alard that even its
revolted members camped round it in its evil hour, held to it
by human feeling after all other links were broken. No one
would leave the neighbourhood while Sir John continued ill
and shaken. Mary stayed at Hastings, and Gervase stayed at
Vinehall, even after his apprenticeship to Gillingham’s had
finally come to an end, and the men had given him a farewell
oyster supper at the White Lion, with a presentation wrist-watch
to add to the little stock of possessions he would have
to give up in a few weeks.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>However, by the beginning of February, Sir John had so far
recovered as to make any waiting unnecessary. He still refused
to see his disloyal son and rebellious daughters. His
illness seemed to have hardened his obstinacy, and to have
brought about certain irritable conditions which sometimes
approached violence and made it impossible to attempt any
persuasion.</p>

<p class='c015'>He came downstairs and took up his indoor life as usual,
though out of doors he no longer rode about on his grey horse.
The entire overseership of the estate devolved on Peter, with
the additional burden that his responsibility was without
authority—his father insisted on retaining the headship and on
revising or overthrowing his decisions. Nothing could be done
without reference to him, and his illness seemed to have made
him queerly perverse. He insisted that an offer from a firm
of timber-merchants for the whole of Little Sowden Wood
should be refused, though Peter explained to him that at
present the wood actually cost more in its upkeep than was
realised by the underwood sales in the local market.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why should I have one of the finest woods on my estate
smashed up by a firm of war-profiteers? Confound you, Sir!
Many’s the fox that hounds have put up in Sowden, and the
place was thick when Conster started building.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But we’re in desperate need of ready money, Father. We
can’t afford to start repairs at Glasseye, and this is the third
year we’ve put off. There’s Monkings, too,—the place is falling
to pieces, and Luck says he’ll quit if he has to wait any
longer.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Quit?—Let him. He needn’t threaten me. Tenants aren’t
so scarce.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good tenants are. We aren’t likely to get a man who farms
the land as well as Luck. He got the Penny field to carry seven
bushel to the acre last year. He’s clockwork with the rent, too—you
know the trouble we have over rent.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I won’t have Sowden cut down to keep him. Timber!
I thought we were done with that shame when the war ended,
and we’d lost Eleven Pounder and Little Horn.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“But I can’t see anything more shameful in selling timber
than in selling land, and you sold that Snailham piece last year
to——”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter tried to retrieve his blunder, but his mind was not for
quick manœuvres and all he could do was to flush and turn
guiltily silent. His father’s anger blazed at once.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—we sold land last year, and a good business we made
of it, didn’t we! The bounder thought he’d bought my daughter
into the bargain. He thought he’d got the pull of us
because we were glad to sell. I tell you, I’ll sell no more of
my land, if it puts such ideas into the heads of the rascals that
buy it, if it makes all the beastly tenants and small-holders
within thirty miles think they can come and slap me on the
back and make love to my daughters and treat me as one of
themselves. I’ll not sell another foot as long as I live. When
I die, Sir, you may not get a penny, but you’ll get the biggest
estate in East Sussex.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter groaned.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 12</h3>

<p class='c014'>Gervase did not think it advisable to go near his family when
the time came for him to leave Vinehall for Thunders Abbey.
He would have liked to see his mother, but knew too well that
the interview would end only in eau de Cologne and burnt
feathers. Since he was exiled, it was best to accept his exile
as a working principle and not go near the house. He knew
that later on he would be given opportunities to see his parents,
and by then time might have made them respectively less
hostile and less hysterical.</p>

<p class='c015'>So he wrote his mother a very affectionate letter, trying to
explain what he was going to do, but not putting any great
faith in her understanding him. He told her that he would
be able to come and see her later, and sent his love to Doris
and Peter and his father. He also wrote a line to Mary. His
personal farewells were for Stella and Jenny only.</p>

<p class='c015'>To Stella he said goodbye the day before he left. He found
her making preparations for her own departure. She and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>father were leaving for Canada as soon as Mrs. Peter Alard
was through her confinement, which she expected in a couple
of weeks. The practice had been sold, and the escape into a
new life and a new country was no longer a possible resort of
desperation but a fixed doom for her unwilling heart.</p>

<p class='c015'>All she had been able to do during the last weeks had been
to let her father act without interference. Her entire conflict
had been set in withholding herself from last-moment entreaties
to stay, from attempts at persuading him to withdraw from
negotiations over the practice, from suggestions that their departure
should be put off to the end of the summer. So negative
had been her battle that she had never felt the thrill of
combat—instead she felt utterly crushed and weary. She felt
both dead and afraid&#160;... the only moments in which she
seemed to live were the moments in which she encountered
Peter, passing him occasionally on the road or meeting him in
a neighbour’s house. They were terrible moments of fiery
concentrated life—she was glad afterwards to fall back into
her stupor. She and he had had no more private conversations—she
was able to pursue her negative battle to the extent of
avoiding these—but his mere presence seemed to make alive a
Stella Mount who was dying, whose death she sometimes
thought of as a blessing and sometimes as a curse.</p>

<p class='c015'>When she saw Gervase, so quiet and sweet-tempered and
happy, she wondered if she would possibly be like that when
her love for Peter was dead, as his for her was dead. But
then his love for her was not dead—that was the whole point;
like Enoch, it was translated—it was not, because God had
taken it. As she looked into his peaceful eyes, her own filled
with tears. She wondered if he had won his battle so quickly
because it had been a slighter one than hers, or because he was
better armed. Probably because of both. He was younger
than she, his passions still slept in his austere, hard-working
youth—and would probably awake only to find themselves reborn
in his religious life—also, she realised that he might be
naturally spiritual, whereas she had never been more than
spiritually natural—a distinction. He was a man born to love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>God as she had been born to love men, and she knew that, in
spite of all he said, he would have found his beloved sooner
or later without any help of hers.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Goodbye, dear Gervase,” she said, and pressed his hand.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Goodbye, Stella”—surprisingly he kissed her, like another
girl. She had not thought he would dare kiss her at all, and
this warm, light, natural kiss—the kiss of a gentle friend—showed
her a self-conquest more complete than any she had
imagined—certainly than any she would ever know. She might
be strong enough to deny her kisses to Peter, but she would
never be able to give him the kiss of a friend.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 13</h3>

<p class='c014'>The next day Gervase drove off to Thunders Abbey, and
went by way of Icklesham. It was a windless afternoon; the
first scent of primroses hid in the hollows of the lanes, and the
light of the sun, raking over the fields, was primrose-coloured
on the grass. The browsing sheep and cattle cast long shadows,
and the shadows of the leafless trees were clear, a delicate
tracery at their roots.</p>

<p class='c015'>As he drove up and down the steep, wheel-scarred lanes he
watched familiar farms and spinneys go by as if it were for
the last time. He knew that he would see them all many times
after this, but somehow it would not be the same. Gervase
Alard would be dead, as Jenny Alard was dead, and he felt as
Jenny had felt the night before her wedding—glad and yet
afraid. He remembered her words—“Can’t you understand?—It’s
because I don’t feel big enough&#160;... afraid.” He, too,
felt afraid of his new life, and for the same reason—because
he knew he was not big enough. Yet, in spite of her fear,
Jenny had gone on, and now she was happy. And he was
going on, and perhaps he would be happy, too.</p>

<p class='c015'>He found her baking little cakes for tea. She tapped on
the kitchen window when the lorry rattled into the yard, and
he came in and took her in his arms, in spite of her protest
that she was all over flour.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“Hullo, Gervase! this is splendid—I haven’t seen you for
ages.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She was wearing a blue gingham overall, and with her face
flushed at the fire, and her background of brick, scrubbed wood
and painted canisters, she looked more like a farmer’s wife
than he could ever have imagined possible. She had grown
plump, too, since her marriage, and her eyes had changed—they
looked bright, yet half asleep, like a cat’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve come to say goodbye, Jen. I’m off to Thunders.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“When?—Tomorrow?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—this very evening. I’ll go straight on from here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase!”</p>

<p class='c015'>She looked sad—she understood him less than ever now.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Father Lawrence wrote two days ago and said they were
able to take me—and I’ve nothing to wait for. Father won’t
see me. I’ve written to Mother—I thought it better than farewells
in the flesh.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And Stella?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve said goodbye to her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase, I know—I feel sure you’re only doing this because
of her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I can’t show you now that you’re wrong, but I hope
time will.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hope it won’t show you that you’re wrong—when it’s too
late. My dear——” she went up to him and put her hands
on his shoulders—“My dear, you’re so young.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t, Jen.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But it’s true. Why can’t you wait till you’ve seen more
of life—till you’ve lived, in fact?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Because I don’t want to give God just the fag-end of myself,
the leavings of what you call life. I want to give Him
the best I’ve got—all my best years.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If Stella had accepted you, you would have married her, and
we shouldn’t have heard anything about all this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s true. But she refused me, and it was her refusal
which showed me the life I was meant for. The fact that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>loved Stella, and she would not have me, showed me that God
does not want me to marry.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He seemed to Jenny transparent and rather silly, like a child.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you’re only twenty-one,” she persisted gently, as she
would with a child. “You’d have been sure to fall in love
again and marry someone else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And there’s no good telling you I’m sure I shouldn’t.
However, my dear, I’m not going to prison on a life sentence—I
can come out tomorrow if I don’t like it; and probably for a
year or so the whole community will be trying to turn me out—they’re
as much afraid of a mistake as you are.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t trust them. They only too seldom get hold of men
in your position.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear, don’t let’s talk any more about me. It’s making
us quarrel, and probably this is the last time I shall see you
for months. Tell me how you’ve been getting on. Has the
County called yet?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not so as you’d notice. As a matter of fact, the Fullers
left cards the other day. Agney’s far enough off for it not to
matter very much, and I think Mrs. Fuller has a reputation for
being broad-minded which she’s had to live up to. But I’m
getting to like Ben’s friends—I told you I should. There’s the
Boormans of Frays Land and the Hatches of Old Place, and
a very nice, well-educated bailiff at Roughter, who collects
prints and old furniture. I see a lot of them—they’ve been
here and I’ve been to their houses; and as Mrs. Godfrey and
the girls keep to their own part of the house, I’ve got my hands
full from morning to night, and don’t have much time to think
about anything I may have lost.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It seems to suit you, anyhow. You look fine.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I feel splendid. Of course, I couldn’t do it if it wasn’t
for Ben. I don’t pretend I’ve found everything in the life
agreeable, after what I’ve been used to. But Ben makes everything
worth doing and worth bearing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And that’s how it is with me. Can’t you understand now,
Jen?—I’ve got something, too, which makes it all worth doing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and worth bearing—though I don’t pretend, any more than you
do, that I expect to find everything in my life agreeable.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll try to understand, Gervase; but I don’t suppose I’ll succeed—and
you really can’t expect it of me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right, I won’t, just yet.” He picked his cap and gloves
off the table—“I really must be going now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Won’t you stay and have some tea? I’ve got over the
failure stage in cakes—I really think these will be quite eatable.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, thanks very much, I mustn’t stay. It’ll take Henry
quite two hours to get to Brighton.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She did not seem to hear him—she was listening. He could
hear nothing, but a moment later a footstep sounded in the
yard.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There he is,” said Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>She went out into the passage and closed the door behind her.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was left alone in the big kitchen. The fire and the kettle
hummed together to the ticking of the clock, and there was a
soft, sweet smell of baking cakes. The last of the sunshine
was spilling through the window on to the scrubbed, deal table,
and over all the scene hung an impalpable atmosphere of comfort,
warmth and peace. Outside in the passage he could hear
the murmuring of a man’s and a woman’s voices.... His eyes
suddenly filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were gone when Jenny came back into the room with
Ben, who had evidently been told the reason for his brother-in-law’s
visit, for he shook hands in clumsy silence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How do you do?” said Gervase—“and goodbye.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ben still said nothing. He neither approved nor understood
young Alard’s ways. Religion was for him the ten commandments,
Parson’s tithes, and harvest thanksgivings—anything
further smacked of Chapel and the piety of small-holders. But
he was too fond of Gervase to say openly what was in his heart,
and as he was not used to saying anything else, he was driven
into an awkward but well-meaning silence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m glad you’re taking Henry with you,” said Jenny, attempting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>lightness—“It would have been dreadful if you’d had
to leave him behind.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—‘The Arab’s Farewell to His Steed’ wouldn’t have
been in it. But I’m taking him as my dowry. They’ll find
some use for him at Thunders—he’s got at least one cylinder
working. If they hadn’t wanted him I’d have given him to
Ben—just to encourage him to start machinery on the farm.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d sooner keep my horses, thank you,” said Ben, relieved
at having something to say at last. “Give me a horse-ploughed
field, even if it does take twice the labour.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you’ll be getting a tractor soon, won’t you? That’s
another idea altogether, and you’ll never find horses to beat
that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus talking of machinery the three of them went to the
door, and said goodbye under cover of argument.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll see me again before long,” cried Gervase, as he
drove off.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Will you be able to write to us?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course I will—look out for a letter in a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c015'>With hideous grindings, explosions and plaints, the lorry
went off down the drive. As it disappeared between the hedgerows,
Jenny felt her heart contract in a pang of helpless pity.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Ben&#160;... he’s so young—and he’s never had anything.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She would have cried, but her husband’s arm slipped round
her, drawing her back into the darkening house.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 14</h3>

<p class='c014'>Jenny had been candid with Gervase in her account of herself.
She was happy—supremely so—but there was much that
would have been difficult were it not for the love which “made
everything worth doing and worth bearing.” She had nothing
to complain of in Ben himself. He was after marriage the
same as he had been before it—gentle, homely, simple and upright,
with a streak of instinctive refinement which compensated
for any lack of stress on the physical cleanliness which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>was the god of her former tribe. It is true that he expected
more of her than Jim Parish, for instance, would have done.
The sight of Jenny rising at half-past six to light the kitchen
fire, cooking the breakfast, and doing all the housework with
the help of one small girl, did not strike him as the act of
wifely devotion and Spartan virtue that it seemed to her and
would have seemed to Jim. It was what the women of his
experience did invariably, and with a certain naïve thickheadedness
he had not expected Jenny, taken from a home of
eight o’clock risings, to be different. But in all other ways he
was considerate—ways in which the men of her class would
most probably not have considered her; and she soon became
used to the physical labour of her days. Indeed, after the first
surprise at his attitude, she realised that anything else would
have brought an atmosphere of unreality into the life which
she loved because it was so genuine. Farmers’ wives—even
prosperous farmers’ wives—did not lie in bed till eight, or sit
idle while the servants worked; and Jenny was now a farmer’s
wife—Mrs. Ben Godfrey of Fourhouses—with her place to
keep clean, her husband and her husband’s men to feed, her
dairy and her poultry to attend to.</p>

<p class='c015'>But though she loved Ben, and loved working for him, there
were other things that were hard, and she was too clear-headed
not to acknowledge the difficulties she had chosen. She often
longed to be alone with her husband, instead of having to share
him with his mother and sisters. According to yeoman custom,
his wife had been brought into his home, which was also his
family’s home, and she must take what she found there. Jenny
realised that she might have been worse off—she was genuinely
fond of Mrs. Godfrey and Lily and Jane, and their separate
quarters gave her a privacy and a freedom she would not have
had on many farms—but she would have been less sensitive
to the gulf between her new life and the old if she had been
alone with Ben. His women, with their constant absorption
in housework—making it not so much a duty to be done and
then forgotten as a religion pervading the whole life—with
their arbitrary standards of decorum, and their total lack of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>interest in any mental processes—often begot in her revolt and
weariness, especially when her husband was much away. She
had not known till then how much she depended on stray
discussions of books and politics, on the interchange of abstract
and general ideas. Ben himself could give her these stimulations,
for the war had enlarged his education, and his love for
her made him eager to meet her on the ground she chose. But
his work often took him into the fields soon after dawn, and
he would not be privately hers again till night, for the meals at
Fourhouses were communal and democratic; not only Mrs.
Godfrey and her daughters, but the stockman, the cow-man,
the carter and the ploughboys sat down to table with the
master.</p>

<p class='c015'>Moreover, after a month or two, she began to feel her
estrangement from her people. She did not miss her old
acquaintances among the county families, but she felt the
silence of her home more than she would ever have imagined
possible. No one from Conster—her father or mother or
Doris—had come near her or sent her a word. There had
been the same silence up at Starvecrow which surprised her
more, for she and Vera had always been friends—though of
course Vera had her own special preoccupations now. Rose
had called, but evidently with a view to replenishing her stores
of gossip for Leasan tea-parties, and Jenny had done all she
could to discourage another visit. Mary generally came over
from Hastings once a week, but hers were only the visits of a
fellow-exile.</p>

<p class='c015'>In her heart, the estrangement which Jenny felt the most
was between herself and Peter. She had not expected such
treatment from him. She had expected anger and disappointment,
certainly, a stormy interview, perhaps, but not this blank.
Sometimes she told herself he was anxious about Vera, and
that his own troubles had combined with her misbehaviour to
keep him away. She forced herself to patience, hoping uncertainly
that the fortunate birth of an heir would bring old
Peter to a better frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile, she was reviving her friendship with Mary, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>rather was building up a new one, for in old times she had felt
a little afraid of her elegant, aloof sister. She was not afraid
of Mary now—indeed, from the vantage of her own happy
establishment she almost pitied this woman who had left so
much behind her in dark places.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary liked Ben—but her temperament had set her at a great
distance from his homely concreteness. Though she stood by
her sister in her adventure, she evidently could not think “what
Jenny saw in him,” and she was openly full of plans for his
improvement and education.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why don’t you lift him up to your level instead of stooping
to his? You could easily do it. He’s deeply in love with you,
and, in my opinion, very much above his own way of life.
Fourhouses is a good estate and he’s got plenty of money to
improve it—with a little trouble he could make it into a country
house and himself into a small squire.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thanks,” said Jenny—“that’s what I’ve just escaped from—country
houses and squires—and I don’t want to start the
whole thing over again. Why should Ben try to make himself
a squire, when the squires are dying out all over the country,
and their estates are being broken up and sold back to the
people they used to belong to?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jenny, you talk like a radical!—‘God gave the land to the
people’ and all that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My husband’s a vice-president of the Conservative Club.
It isn’t for any political reasons that I don’t want to fight my
way back into the county. It’s simply that I’m sick of two
things—struggle and pretence. Situated as I am, I’ve got
neither—if I tried to keep what I gave up when I married Ben,
I’d have both.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s all very well for you to talk like this now—when everything’s
new. Even I know what the first months of marriage
can be like.... But later on, when things have sobered down,
you’ll feel different—you’ll want to see some of your old
friends again, and wish you hadn’t shut them out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you mean the Parishes and the Hursts and the Wades
and all that lot, nothing I could ever do would make them my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>friends again. You see, they’re friends of Father’s, and, considering
his attitude towards my marriage—which would be
the same whatever I did to ‘raise’ myself—they can never be
friends of mine. It isn’t as if I’d moved thirty miles off and
had a new sort of ‘county’ to visit me. I’m in the middle of
the old crowd, and they can never be friendly with me without
offending my people. No, I must be content with Ben’s friends—if
I tried to ‘improve’ him we’d lose those, too, and then I’d
have nobody.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I daresay you’re right, my dear—you sound practical, anyway.
And I’ve no right to teach anyone how to arrange their
lives.... It’s queer, isn’t it, Jen? I took, generally speaking,
no risks when I married. I married a man I loved, a man of
my own class, whom my people approved of—and look at me
now. You, on the other hand, have taken every imaginable
risk—a runaway match, a different class, and the family
curse....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll have to look at me twelve years hence to compare
me with you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think you’re going to be all right, though—even if you
don’t take my advice.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sure I shall be all right. You see, I’m doing everything
with my eyes open. You didn’t have your eyes open, Mary.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know I didn’t. Very few women do. Most brides are
like newborn kittens with their eyes shut.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you happy now?”</p>

<p class='c015'>It was the first time she had dared ask the question. Mary
hesitated—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I suppose I am happy. I have enough to live on, I
have my friends—I travel about, and see places and people.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you ever regretted that you didn’t marry Charles?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Regretted! Good Lord, no! The very opposite. I didn’t
love him in that way, and we’d both have been wretched. Poor
old dear! I’m glad I’d strength enough to spare him that,
though I spared him nothing else....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you ever see him now?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sometimes. He’s married, you know—a very young thing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>who doesn’t like me too much. I didn’t expect him to marry,
but I believe he’s happy. I hear that Julian is happy, too—he
has two little boys and a baby girl. So I haven’t really done
either of my men much harm.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—it’s you who’ve suffered the harm. Why haven’t you
married again, Mary? I’ve always expected you to.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her sister shook her head.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t—there’s something in me lacking for that. I can’t
explain, and it sounds an extraordinary thing to say, but I
feel as if I’d left it with Julian. I don’t mean that I still love
him or any nonsense like that—I hadn’t loved him for a year
before I left him&#160;... but somehow one doesn’t get rid of a
husband as easily as the divorce-courts and the newspapers
seem to suppose.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you’d married again you’d have forgotten Julian.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I shouldn’t, and I should have made another man unhappy—because
of what’s lacking in me. I know there are
lots of women who can go from the church to the divorce court
and from the divorce court to the registrar’s, and leave
nothing behind them in any of these places. But I’m not like
that—I left my love with Julian and my pride with Charles.
Sometimes I feel that if only I’d had the strength to stick to
Julian a little longer, we’d have weathered things through—I’d
have got back what I’d lost, and all this wouldn’t have
happened. But it’s waste of time to think of that now....
Don’t worry about me, Jen. I’m happy in my own way—though
it may not be yours, or many women’s, for that matter.
I’ve just managed to be strong enough not to spoil Charles’s
life—not to drag him down—so I’ve got one good memory....
And I’m free—that means more to me than perhaps you
can realise—and I enjoy life as a spectator. I’ve suffered
enough as an actor on the stage, and now I’m just beginning to
feel comfortable in the stalls.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t,” said Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>She could not bear any more—this was worse than Gervase.
To have spent all the treasure of life on dust and wind was
even worse than to give up that treasure unspent. She found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the tears running out of her eyes as she put her arms round
Mary—softness of furs and sweetness of violets, and in the
midst of them a sister who was half doll and half ghost.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 15</h3>

<p class='c014'>Towards the end of March, Peter’s daughter was born. He
bore the disappointment better than anyone had expected. But
lately it had not seemed to him to matter very much whether
the child were a boy or a girl. His horizons were closing in
upon him—they had even shut out his own inheritance, with
the new powers and freedoms it would bring, and he could not
look so far ahead as the prospects of his heir. Even Gervase’s
defection had not stirred him long. In his first shock of outrage
and disgust he had motored over to Thunders Abbey and
tried to persuade his brother to come back with him, but
finding him obdurate, his emotions had collapsed into a contempt
which was queerly mixed with envy. If Gervase preferred
these debased states of life—first in a garage and then
in a monastery—to the decencies of his position as an Alard,
then let him have what he wanted. It was something to know
what one wanted and take it unafraid. Gervase might be a
traitor, but he was not a fool.</p>

<p class='c015'>So Peter heard unmoved Dr. Mount’s announcement that a
little girl had been born, and only a trifle less unmoved received
the woolly bundle of his little daughter into his arms. He did
not, as some men, awake to a new sense of fatherhood at the
touch of his first-born. His failure as a husband seemed to
affect him as a father. He did not ask himself what he would
have felt if the child had been a boy. The only question in
his heart was what he would have felt if it had been Stella’s
child&#160;... but that was a useless question.</p>

<p class='c015'>Vera was secretly glad to have a girl. She had always
wanted a daughter, and lately, as her mind had detached itself
more and more from her husband’s wishes, the want had
become anxious. A boy she always pictured as a second Peter—heavy,
obstinate, his heart set on things she did not care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>about—but a girl would be a companion, and her own. There
would be, she felt, some chance of her growing up like her
mother and sharing her mother’s adventures in intellect and
beauty; also, in that new florescence of her race which had
accompanied her pregnancy, she felt that her daughter would
be truly a daughter of Abraham, whereas her son would be
born into a public-school tradition and the heirship of a big
estate—a child of the Goyim. So she stretched out her arms
gladly when the baby girl was put into them, and as she looked
down into the mysterious, ancient little face of the newborn,
her heart leapt with joy and pride to see the tokens of her blood
already discernible, not so much in its later Hebraic characteristics
as in some general oriental quality, older than Abraham.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s nothing of the Goy about her, is there?” she said
to her mother, who had come to be with her in her confinement.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, indeed, there’s not. She takes after us. It’s curious
how they nearly always do in a mixed marriage.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But, in the midst of her own gratification, Vera was glad to
find that her husband was not bitterly disappointed. Poor old
Peter! He had been estranged from her, she knew, and had
wanted to marry the Mount woman, but she could forgive him
in the triumph of her recovery. She had the child, and was
rapidly getting well. When she was herself again she would
win him back. She knew how&#160;... it never failed.</p>

<p class='c015'>In her presence Peter made his disappointment seem even
less than it really was. The sight of her lying there in loveliness
both opulent and exhausted—knowing vaguely what she
had suffered and accepted—stirred in him a strange, admiring
pity which forbade an unthankful word. He bore no resentment
against her now. It was not her fault that she stood
between him and Stella. Probably he had treated her badly—she
might have suffered nearly as much as he.... And he was
glad she had her reward.</p>

<p class='c015'>But even when looking tenderly down on her, speaking tenderly
to her, he could not picture himself going on with their
marriage again. When his family and acquaintance tried to
cheer him up for the disappointment of having a girl, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>always said, “But it’s only the first, Peter...” “The first never
really matters....” and all the time he was feeling that there
could not be another. It was a preposterous feeling, he knew,
for, after Gervase’s defection, it was imperative that he should
have an heir; and men are not like women in these things. He
had never had Stella—he could never have Stella. Why should
he feel this aversion from doing his duty as a husband and an
Alard? He did not know—but he felt it, almost to shrinking.
He felt that his marriage was at an end—broken and yet binding—for
Stella could not take him after divorce any more than
she could take him without it. And everyone said “It’s only
the first”.... “It’s just as well for the girl to come first—to
be the oldest.”...</p>

<p class='c015'>A few days after the baby’s birth Vera had a letter from
Jenny, congratulating her and sending her love to Peter. She
did not ask her brother to come over and see her, but Peter
guessed what was behind her message. In the loneliness of
those first days when the house seemed full of women and
affairs from which he was shut out, he had a longing to go
over to Fourhouses, and see Jenny and be friends again. But
he was held back, partly by a feeling of awkwardness, a sense
of the explanations and reproaches his visit would involve,
partly by a remaining stiffness against her treachery, and most
of all by a dull stirring sense of envy—the same as, though
more accountable than, the envy he had felt for Gervase.
Here again was someone who knew what she wanted and had
got it, whom the family had not bound fast and swallowed up—and
the worst of it all was that, unlike Gervase, she had got
what Peter wanted, too. In vain he told himself that she could
never be happy with Godfrey, could never adapt herself to the
life she had chosen, that her plunge would be no more justified
than his withdrawal. He dared not go near Fourhouses all
the same.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 16</h3>

<p class='c014'>The hopes on which the baby’s birth seemed to have fallen
heaviest were Sir John’s. The old man had had none of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Peter’s uncertainty or anxiety before the event—he had felt
sure the child would be a boy. The news that it was a girl
had been a terrible shock, and though it had not, as was feared
at first, brought on another seizure, it was soon seen to have
increased the nervous unsteadiness of his constitution. He
alone, of all the Alards, did not join in the cry of “This is the
first.” First or last, it was probably the only grandchild he
would live to see, and he expressed his disappointment with
the candid selfishness of old age.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here have I been waiting for a boy—counting on a boy—and
it’s a girl after all. What good’s a girl to us? We’ve got
plenty of girls—or those who were once girls”—and he glared
at Doris—“all they do is either to disgrace us in the divorce-courts,
marry the sweep, or turn into bad-tempered old maids.
We’ve got enough girls. It’s a boy we want—with that Gervase
gone off to be a monk. I’ve been badly served by my
children.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Father, it wasn’t Peter’s fault,” urged Doris unskilfully.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wasn’t it, Ma’am? You <em>do</em> know a lot—more than an unmarried
woman ought to know about such things. I believe
you even know that the baby wasn’t found under a gooseberry
bush.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Father, don’t talk in such a dreadful way—He’s really
getting quite awful,” she said as she let Peter out—“I sometimes
think there’s something wrong with his brain.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There probably is,” said Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>Indeed, of late Sir John had grown alarmingly eccentric.
His love of rule had passed beyond the administration of his
estate, and showed itself in a dozen ways of petty dominion.
He seemed resolved to avenge his authority over the three
rebellious children on the two who had remained obedient.
Not only did he put up a forest of forbidding notices over his
estate, to keep out the general public, which had hitherto had
free entrance to most of his fields and woods, but he forbade
his own children to use certain paths. He would not let Peter
come by the field way from Starvecrow, but insisted on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>going round by the road. He would stop Doris on the threshold
of an afternoon’s calling, and compel her to sit and read
to him, by choice books which he calculated to offend her old-maidish
susceptibilities. He found Doris better game than
Peter, for whereas the son remained silent under his kicks,
Doris never failed to give him all the fun he wanted in the
way of protests, arguments, laments and tears. But from both
he obtained obedience, through their dread of exciting him and
bringing on another stroke.</p>

<p class='c015'>His warfare was less open with his wife. He attacked her
indirectly through the servants, who were always giving notice
owing to his intimidation. Even Wills had once distantly informed
his mistress that since Sir John did not seem to
appreciate his services he might soon have to consider the
advisability of transferring them elsewhere. Appleby had
actually given notice, after a mysterious motor drive, from
which Sir John had returned on foot—but had been persuaded
by Peter to reconsider it and stay on. The female staff was
in a state of perpetual motion. No cook would stand her
master’s comments on her performances, no housemaid endure
his constant bullying and bell-ringing. He had perversely
moved into a top-floor bedroom, so as to be out of reach of
his wife and Speller, who disliked stairs. Here he would make
tea at five o’clock every morning with water from his hot-water
bottle boiled up on a spirit lamp. This procedure filled
Lady Alard with a peculiar horror when she discovered it;
indeed, from her remarks it would appear that all her husband’s
other misdoings were negligible in comparison.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 17</h3>

<p class='c014'>A few days before Easter, Peter came suddenly to Fourhouses.
He came early in the afternoon, and gave no explanation
either of his coming or of his staying away. Jenny was
upstairs, helping her mother-in-law turn out the conjugal bedroom,
when she heard the sound of hoofs in the yard. She
ran to the window, thinking it was Ben come home unexpectedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>from an errand to Wickham Farm, but had no time
to be disappointed in the rush of her surprise at seeing Peter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s Peter—my brother—come at last!” she cried to
Mrs. Godfrey, and, tearing off her dusting cap, she ran downstairs,
still in her gingham overall. She wanted to open the
door to him herself.</p>

<p class='c015'>He could not have expected her to do this, for he was staring
uninterestedly at his boots. Her gingham skirts evidently suggested
a servant to him, for he lifted his eyes slowly, then
seemed surprised to see her standing all bright and blowzed
before him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jenny!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hullo, Peter! So you’ve come to see me at last.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He mumbled something about having been passing through
Icklesham.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Won’t you come in?—the man’ll take your horse. Hi!
Homard—take Mr. Alard’s horse round to the stable.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t stop long,” said Peter awkwardly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you must, after all this time—come in.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She had meant to ask him why he had kept away so long
and why he had come now; but when she found herself alone
with him in the kitchen, she suddenly changed her mind, and
decided to let things be. He probably had no reasonable explanation
to offer, and unless she meant to keep the breach
unhealed, she had better treat this visit as if there was nothing
to explain about it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How’s Vera?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’s getting on splendidly, thanks.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And the baby?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s getting on too.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do tell me about it—is it like her or like you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s like her—a regular little Yid.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Never mind—she will probably grow up very beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter mumbled inaudibly.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny looked at him critically. He seemed heavier and
stupider than usual. He gave her the impression of a man
worn out.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>“You don’t look well.... Are you worried? I do hope
you aren’t dreadfully disappointed the baby’s a girl.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It doesn’t really matter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course not. The first one never does. You’re sure to
have others&#160;... boys.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter did not answer, and Jenny felt a little annoyed with
him. If this was the way he behaved at home she was sorry
for Vera. It was curious how nervy these stolid men often
were....</p>

<p class='c015'>“How are Father and Mother?” she asked, to change the
subject—“I suppose you go up to Conster every day.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Twice most days. They’re not up to much—at least Father
isn’t. He’s had some pretty good shocks lately, you know.
He was dreadfully upset the baby’s being a girl—and that fool
Gervase’s business was a terrible blow for him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was a blow for me too. I did my best to put him off
it, but it was no use. My only comfort is that apparently it’ll
be some time before he’s really let in for it. He may come
to his senses before then.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t think so. He’s as obstinate as the devil.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What—have <em>you</em> tried arguing with him?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—when I heard what he’d done, I drove over to Thunders
Abbey or whatever it’s called, and did my level best to
bring him back with me. But it was all no good—you might
as well try to argue with a dead owl.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good Lord!—you went over to Thunders, and tried to
bring him back! Poor old Peter! But do tell me how he is,
and what he’s doing. What sort of place is it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh a great big barrack, spoiling the country for miles
round. But they’ve got some fine land and absolutely all the
latest ideas in farming—motor traction and chemical fertilisation
and all that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And was Gervase working on the farm?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, Brother Joseph—that’s what the fool’s called now—Brother
Joseph, when I saw him, was scrubbing out the kitchen
passage on his hands and knees like a scullery maid. A dignified
occupation for an Alard!”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>“Poor old Gervase, how he’d hate that! But he’ll be all
the more likely to come to his senses and give it up, especially
when he’s got over his disappointment about Stella. I feel
it’s really that which was at the bottom of it all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter did not speak for a moment. He leaned back in his
wooden armchair, staring at the fire, which was leaping ruddily
into the chimney’s cavern.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you mind if I light my pipe?” he asked after a bit.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course not—do. I’m glad you’re going to stay.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He took matches and his tobacco pouch out of his pocket,
and she noticed suddenly that his hands were shaking. For
the first time a dreadful suspicion seized her. His heaviness—his
nerviness—his queer, lost manner&#160;... was it possible,
she wondered, that Peter <em>drank</em>?</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have you heard when the Mounts are leaving?” she asked
him, stifling her thoughts.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella was here three days ago, and she said that they’ve
at last settled about the practice. She seemed to think they
might be free to go at the end of May.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I expect Vera’s glad they didn’t go off in a hurry, and leave
her with a new man for the baby. Dr. Mount’s the best maternity
doctor for miles round.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I’ve heard that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He was falling back into silence, and no remark of hers
on any topic seemed able to rouse him out of it, though she
tried once or twice to re-animate him on the subject of Gervase.
He lounged opposite her in his armchair, puffing at his
pipe, and staring at the fire, now and then painfully dragging
out a “yes” or a “no.” She was beginning to feel bored with
him and to think about her work upstairs. Was this all he
had to say to her after three months’ estrangement?—an
estrangement which he had never troubled to explain. She
had been weak with him—let him off too easily—she ought to
have “had things out with him” about her marriage. She had a
right to know his reasons for forgiving her just as she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>a right to know his reasons for shunning her.... He had
treated her inexplicably.</p>

<p class='c015'>She was working herself up to wrath like this when Peter
suddenly spoke of his own accord.</p>

<p class='c015'>“This place is like what Starvecrow used to be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Used to be?—when?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Before Vera and I came to it—when the Greenings had it.
Do you remember the kitchen fireplace?—it was just like this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Starvecrow is far grander than Fourhouses now. I’m
just a plain farmer’s wife, Peter—I’m never going to pretend
to be anything else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And Starvecrow was just a plain farm; but we’ve changed
it into a country house.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mary’s been wanting me to do the same for Fourhouses,
but I’ve told her I’d be very sorry to. I like it best as it is.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So do I.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then are you sorry you’ve altered Starvecrow?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But it’s a lovely place, Peter. You’ve made a perfect little
country house out of it. I’m sure you wouldn’t be pleased
to have it the ramshackle old thing it used to be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I should.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, Vera wouldn’t, anyhow. You and she are in a
totally different position from us. I’m not keeping Fourhouses
as it is because I don’t think it’s capable of improvement,
but because I don’t want to put myself outside my class
and ape the county. You’re just the opposite—you’ve got appearances
to keep up; it would never do if you lived in the
funny hole Starvecrow used to be in the Greenings’ time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I loved it then—it was just like this—the kitchen fire&#160;...
and the fire in the office—it used to hum just like this—as
if there was a kettle on it. The place I’ve got now isn’t
Starvecrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What is it, then?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t know—but it isn’t Starvecrow. I’ve spoilt Starvecrow.
I’ve changed it, I’ve spoilt it—Vera’s people have spoilt
it with their damned money. It isn’t Starvecrow. Do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>remember how the orchard used to come right up to the side
wall? They’ve cut it down and changed it into a garden. The
orchard’s beyond the garden—then it doesn’t look so much
like a farm. A country house doesn’t have an orchard just
outside the drawing-room windows....”</p>

<p class='c015'>He had left his chair, and was pacing up and down the
room. His manner seemed stranger than ever, and Jenny
felt a little frightened.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m glad you don’t want me to change Fourhouses,” she
said soothingly—“I must tell Mary what you’ve said.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I do want you to change it,” he cried—“I can’t bear
to see it as it is—what Starvecrow used to be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t be silly, Peter. Starvecrow is much better now than
it ever used to be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He turned on her almost angrily—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Goodbye.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She felt glad he was going, and still more glad to hear her
husband’s voice calling her from the yard.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s Ben. Must you really be going, Peter?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—I must.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He walked out of the room, and she followed him—both
meeting Ben on the doorstep. Young Godfrey was surprised
to see his elder brother-in-law—he had made up his mind that
Peter would never come to Fourhouses. He was still more
surprised at his abstracted greeting.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hullo, Godfrey. Glad to see you—that’s a fine mare.
Jenny, will you tell them to bring my horse round?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes.... Carter! Mr. Alard’s horse.... Peter can’t
stay any longer, Ben. I told him you’d be sorry.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sure I’m very sorry, Sir”—he blushed at his slip into
deference, but was quite unable to say “Peter”—“Is Mrs.
Alard doing well?” he asked clumsily.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very well, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hope you’ll come and see us again soon,” said Jenny—“I’d
like to show you the house.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I’ll come,” he returned absently, and went to meet his
horse, which was being led to him across the yard.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ 18</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The sun was still high as Peter rode back through the crosscountry
lanes to Starvecrow. The days were lingering now,
and the fields were thickening for May. In the hay-fields the
young crops were already marking their difference from the
pastures with a rust of sorrel and a gilding of buttercups,
and the hedges were losing their traceried outline in smothers
of vetch and convolvulus.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter mechanically noted the progress of the winter sowings
on Scragoak, Stonelink, and other farms he passed. These
were all dependencies of Alard, and their welfare was bound up
with Conster. Pleasant, homely places, their sprawling picturesqueness
made up for any want of repair to all but the
eye of his father’s agent. Peter saw the needs of most of
them—rebuilding, rethatching, redraining—and his mind,
mechanically and from force of habit, deplored the impossibility
of taking action. The position seemed quite hopeless, for he
could do nothing now, and things would be even worse at his
father’s death, when the weight of death-duties and the pressure
of mortgage holders would probably choke out the little
life there was left in the Alard estates. But even this ultimate
foreboding was only mechanical—his real emotions, his most
vital pains, were all centred in himself.</p>

<p class='c015'>He had spoken truly when he told Jenny that he could not
bear the sight of Fourhouses. He could not even bear the
thought of it. When he thought of that quiet, ancient house,
with its bricked floors and wide, sunny spaces, with its humming
kitchen fire and salt-riddled beam-work—above all when
he thought of it as the home of loving hearts and the peace
which follows daring—he felt unendurably the contrast of
what he had made of Starvecrow. It was what Starvecrow
used to be—it was what Starvecrow might have been&#160;... for
even if he had renounced the place he loved for the woman
he loved, Starvecrow would have still gone on being the same,
either as the home of another agent, or—if his father had
really fulfilled his threat of selling it—the home of some honest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>farmer like Ben Godfrey, a man who would not only live in
it but possess it, and give it back the yeoman dignity it had
lost.</p>

<p class='c015'>Starvycrow—Starvycrow.</p>

<p class='c015'>What was it now? What had he made it? It was a small
country house, perfectly furnished and appointed, with a set
of model buildings attached. It was the home of a burnt-out
love, of the husks of marriage, of a husband and wife whose
hearts were foes and whose souls were strangers, of lost illusions,
of dead hopes, and wasted sacrifices. That was what
it was now. That was what he had made it.</p>

<p class='c015'>He remembered words which long ago he had spoken to
Stella.... “Places never change—they are always the same.
Human beings may change, but places never do.” Those words
were untrue—places can change, do change—Starvecrow had
changed, he had changed it. While Stella, the woman, had
not changed. She was still the same—the dear, the lovely&#160;...
and the unchanged, unchanging Stella might have been his
instead of this changed Starvecrow. He had sacrificed the
substance of life to a dream, a shadow, which without the substance
must go up in smoke. He had sold his birth-right for
a morsel of bread—or rather he had given away his bread for
the sake of an inheritance in the clouds, which he could never
hold.</p>

<p class='c015'>His old hopes and his old fears had died together. Neither
the fact that his newborn child was a girl, nor the final defection
of Gervase the heir-apparent could make him hold his
breath for Alard. These things had not killed his dreams, as
once he had thought, but had merely shown that they were
dead. The thought of his father’s death, which could not now
be far off, and his own succession to the property, with all
the freedom and power it would bring, no longer stirred his
flagging ambition. When he became Sir Peter he could probably
save the House of Alard in spite of death-duties and
mortgagees. Without restrictions, master of his own economies,
he could put new life into the failing estate—or at
least he could nurse and shelter it through its difficult times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>till the days came when the government <em>must</em> do something
to set the Squires on their legs again.... But the thought
had no power to move him—indeed Alard hardly seemed worth
saving. It was a monster to which he had sacrificed his uttermost
human need. Gervase had been a wise man, after
all. And Jenny&#160;... Jenny had done what Peter might have
done. He and Stella might now have been together in some
wide farmhouse, happy, alive and free. This child might
have been her child.... Oh, how could he have been so
blind? He had not known how much he really loved her—he
had thought she was just like other women he had loved,
and that he could forget her. She would go away, and she
would manage at last to forget him; but he who stayed behind
would never be able to forget her. He would live on
and on, live on her memory—the memory of her touch and
voice, her narrow shining eyes, her laughter and her kisses—live
on and on until even memory grew feeble, and his heart
starved, and died.</p>

<p class='c015'>Riding over the farms between Leasan and Vinehall it suddenly
struck him how easily he might turn aside and go to
see Stella. She had promised that she would see him again
before she went away. Should he go now and ask her to redeem
that promise? Should he go and plead with her as
he had never pleaded before? She could still save him—she
could still be to him what she might have been. In one mad
moment he saw himself and Stella seeking love’s refuge at
the other end of the country, in some far, kindly farm in Westmoreland
or Cornwall. Vera would divorce him—she would
be only too glad to get her freedom—and by the time he became
Sir Peter Alard he would have lived the scandal down.
Stella still loved him—she was awake, alive, and passionate—she
had none of the scruples and conventions, reserves and
frigidities which keep most women moral—she had only her
religion to stand between them, and Peter did not think much
of that. A collection of dreams, traditions and prohibitions
could not stand before his pleading—before the pleading of
her own heart. He had not really pleaded with her yet....</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>For a moment he reined in his horse, hesitating at the mouth
of the little lane which twists through the hollows of Goatham
and Doucegrove towards Vinehall. But the next minute
he went on again, driven by a question. What had he to offer
Stella in exchange for all that he proposed to take from her?—What
had he to give her in exchange for her father, her
home, her good name, her peace of mind? The answer was
quite plain—he had nothing but himself. And was he worth
the sacrifice? Again a plain answer—No. He was worn,
tired, disillusioned, shop-soiled, no fit mate for the vivid
woman whom some hidden source of romance seemed to keep
eternally young. Even suppose he could, by storming and
entreaty, bend her to his desire, he would merely be bringing
her to where he stood today. A few years hence she might
stand as he stood now—looking back on all she had lost....
He would not risk bringing her to that. Three years ago he
had sacrificed her to his desires—he had made her suffer....
It would be a poor atonement to sacrifice her again—to another
set of desires. The least he could do for her was to let her
follow her own way of escape—to let her go&#160;... though still
he did not know how he was to live without her.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 19</h3>

<p class='c014'>When he reached home he went upstairs to see Vera. Her
mother and Rose were with her, and they were having tea.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hullo!” said his wife—“Where have you been all day?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I lunched over at Becket’s House—Fuller asked me to stay.
And in the afternoon I went to see Jenny.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He had not meant to tell them, but now he suddenly found
he had done so. Vera lifted her eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh. So you’ve forgiven her at last. I think you might
have told me before you went there. I want to thank her
for writing to me, and you could have saved me the fag of
a letter. She’ll think it odd my not sending any message.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sorry, but I never thought of going till I found myself
over there.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“And how is Jenny?” asked Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'>“She seemed very well.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And happy?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—and happy.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is she still living like the wife of a working-man, with
only one maid?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, not like the wife of a working-man, who doesn’t keep
even one maid, but like the wife of a well-to-do farmer, which
she is.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You needn’t bite my head off, Peter,” said Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your tea’s in the drawing-room,” said Vera—“I asked
Weller to put it there ready for you when you came in. Nurse
thinks it would be too much of a crowd if you had it up here.
Besides, I know you’d rather be alone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter rose from his seat at the bedside.</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right—I’ll go downstairs.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I didn’t mean now, you old silly,” said Vera, pulling at his
coat. “Hang it all, I haven’t seen you the whole day.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter looked down at her hopelessly—at her large, swimming
brown eyes, at her face which seemed mysteriously to
have coarsened without losing any of its beauty, at the raven-black
braids of her hair that showed under her lace nightcap,
and last of all at her mouth—full, crimson, satisfied, devouring....
He became suddenly afraid—of her, with this
additional need of him, this additional hold on him, which her
motherhood had brought—and of himself, because he knew
now that he hated her, quite crudely and physically hated her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m afraid I can’t stay—I’ve got rather a headache&#160;...
and I’m going out directly to pot rabbits.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s an odd cure for a headache,” said Vera. She
looked hurt and angry, and he felt a brute to have upset her
at such a time. But he could not help it—he had to go, and
moved towards the door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Aren’t you going to take any notice of your little daughter?”
purred Mrs. Asher—“Baby dear, I don’t think your
daddy’s very proud of you. He hasn’t been near you since
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Speechlessly Peter went to the cradle and gazed down on
the little wizened face. His heart felt hard; not one pang
of fatherhood went through it. “You little sheeny—you little
Yid”—he said to the baby in his heart.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Isn’t she a darling?” his mother-in-law breathed into his
neck—“isn’t she a love? Do you know, Vera thinks now that
Miriam would do better than Rachel—it goes better with
Alard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter did not think that either went particularly well with
Alard, but he said nothing. Wasn’t there a Jewish name
which meant “The glory is departed from my house”?</p>

<p class='c015'>He kissed the baby and went out, thankful to have escaped
kissing the mother.</p>

<p class='c015'>Some truth-loving providence had insisted on afflicting him
with the headache he had claimed as an excuse for not sitting
with Vera. His head ached abominably as he went into the
drawing-room where his tea was laid. The firelight ruddied
the white walls, the silver and the furniture, where comfort
and cretonne were skilfully blended with oak and antiquity.
His thoughts flew back to the evening when he and Vera had
first come into this room on their return from their honeymoon.
He had thought it beautiful then—though even then
he had realised it was not the right room for Starvecrow. It
used to be one of the kitchens, and in the old days when he
had first known it, had had a bricked floor and a big range,
like the kitchen at Fourhouses. Tonight he hated it—it was
part of the processes which had changed Starvecrow out of
recognition. He rang the bell impatiently. He would have
his tea carried into the office. That was the room which had
altered least.</p>

<p class='c015'>Even here there were changes, but they were of his own
choice and making—he had planned them long before his
marriage. The furniture of Greening’s day—the pitch-pine
desk and cane-seated chairs—had been impossible; he had
always meant to get a good Queen Anne bureau like this one,
and some gate-backed chairs like these. There was nothing un-farmlike
in this plainly furnished office, with its walls adorned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>with scale-maps and plans of fields and woods, and notices of
auctions and agricultural shows.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nevertheless today he found himself wishing he had it as
it used to be. He would like to see it as it used to be—as
Stella used to see it, when she came in fresh and glowing on
a winter’s afternoon, to sit beside the fire&#160;... he could almost
feel her cold cheek under his lips....</p>

<p class='c015'>Then for one moment he saw it as it used to be. For an
instant of strangeness and terror he saw the old scratched
desk, with Greening’s files and account-books upon it, saw
Greening’s book-shelves, with their obsolete agricultural
treatises—saw the horse-hair armchair and the two other
chairs with the cane seats, and the picture-advertisement of
Thorley’s cake on the wall.... He stood stock still, trembling—and
then suddenly the room was itself again, and it didn’t
even seem as if it had altered.... But he felt dreadfully
queer. He hurried to the door and went out through the passage
into the little grass space at the back. God! he must be
ill. What a fright he’d had! Suppose the hallucination had
continued a moment longer, should he have seen Stella come
into the room, unbuttoning her fur collar, her face all fresh
with the wind?...</p>

<p class='c015'>He went round to the front of the house, and fetched his
hat and overcoat and gun. He’d go out after the rabbits, as
he’d said. There were too many of them, and he’d promised
Elias&#160;... anyhow he couldn’t stand the house. He whistled
for Breezy, and the spaniel ran out to him, bounding and
whimpering with delight. The sky was turning faintly green
at the rims. The dusk was near.</p>

<p class='c015'>He passed quickly through the yard. From the open doorway
of the cowhouse came cheerful sounds of milking, and
he could see his cows standing in shafts of mote-filled sunlight.
The cowhouse had been enlarged and modernised—Starvecrow
could almost now be called a model farm. But he knew that
the place wanted to be what it was in the old days—before
his wife’s money had been spent on it. It was not only he who
was dissatisfied with the changes—Starvecrow itself did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>like them. He knew that tonight as he walked through the
barns.... Starvecrow had never been meant for a well-appointed
country house, or a model farm. It ought to have
been, like Fourhouses, the home of happy lovers. It was
meant to be a home.... It was not a home now—just a
place where an unhappy man and woman lived, desiring, fleeing,
mistrusting, failing each other. He could have made it
a home—brought Stella to it somehow, some day, at last. Perhaps—seeing
his father’s condition, that day would not have
been far off now.... But like everything else, Starvecrow
had been sacrificed to Alard. He had sacrificed it—he had
betrayed the faithful place. He saw now that he had betrayed
not only himself, not only Stella, but also Starvecrow.</p>

<p class='c015'>Starvycrow—Starvycrow.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter walked quickly, almost running, from the reproach
of Starvycrow.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 20</h3>

<p class='c014'>At about seven o’clock that evening a message came up
from Conster, and as Peter was still out, it was brought to
Vera. It was marked “immediate,” so she opened it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Who brought this, Weller?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The gardener’s boy, Ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Tell him Mr. Alard is out at present, but I’ll send him
over as soon as he comes home——Sir John’s had another
stroke,” she told her mother.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, my dear! How dreadful—I wish you hadn’t opened
the letter. Shocks are so bad for you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It wasn’t a shock at all, thanks. I’ve been expecting it
for weeks. Besides, one really can’t want the poor old man
to live much longer. He was getting a perfect nuisance to
himself and everybody, and if he’d lived on might have done
some real damage to the estate. Now Peter may just be able
to save it, in spite of the death-duties.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, my dear, he isn’t dead yet!” cried Mrs. Asher, a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>shocked. She belonged to a generation to which the death
of anybody however old, ill, unloved or unlovely, could never
be anything but a calamity.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s not likely to survive a second stroke,” said Vera
calmly. “I’m sorry for the poor old thing, but really it’s time
he went. And I want Peter to come into the estate before
he’s quite worn out and embittered. It’s high time he was his
own master—it’ll pull him together again—he’s been all to
pieces lately.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And it’ll quite settle the Stella Mount business,” she added
secretly to herself.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next hour passed, and Weller came up to ask if she
should bring in the dinner.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What <em>can</em> have happened to Peter!” exclaimed Vera.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I daresay he met the messenger on his way back, and went
straight to Conster.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then it was very inconsiderate of him not to send me
word. Yes, Weller, bring the dinner up here. You’ll have
it with me, won’t you, Mother, as Peter isn’t in?”</p>

<p class='c015'>They were eating their fruit when Weller came in with
another “Urgent.” It was from Doris, and ran—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Hasn’t Peter come back yet? Do send him over at once
whenever he does. Father is dying. Dr. Mount does not
expect him to last the night. We have wired to Jenny and
Mary and even Gervase. Do send Peter along. He ought
to be here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How exactly like Doris to write as if we were deliberately
keeping Peter away! <em>I</em> don’t know where he is. Doris might
realise that I’m the last person who’d know.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her hands were trembling, and she whimpered a little as
she crushed up the note and flung it across the room into the
fireplace.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t be upset, Vera darling. Nothing could possibly
have happened to him—we should have heard. He’s probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>accepted a sudden invitation to dinner, the same as he
did to lunch.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know nothing’s happened to him—I’m not afraid of that.
I know where he is....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then if you know&#160;...”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s with Stella Mount,” and Vera hid her face in the
pillow, sobbing hysterically.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Asher tried to soothe her, tried to make her turn over
and talk coherently, but with that emotional abandonment
which lay so close to her mental sophistication, she remained
with her face obstinately buried, and sobbed on. Her mother
had heard about Stella Mount, chiefly from Rose, but had
never given the idea much credit. She did not credit it now.
But to pacify Vera she sent over a carefully worded message
to Dr. Mount’s cottage, asking that if Mr. Peter Alard was
there he should be told at once that he was wanted over at
Conster.</p>

<p class='c015'>The boy came back with the reply that Mr. Alard was not
at Vinehall, and had not been there that day. Everyone but
the maid was out—Dr. Mount at Conster Manor and Miss
Mount in church.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That proves nothing,” said Vera—“he needn’t have met
her at the house.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But if she’s in church——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How do we know she’s in church? She only left word
with the maid that she’s gone there——” and Vera’s sobs
broke out again until the nurse begged her to calm herself
for the sake of the child. Which she promptly did, for she
was a good mother.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 21</h3>

<p class='c014'>At Conster all the family was by now assembled, with the
exception of Peter and Gervase. Ben Godfrey had brought
Jenny over from Fourhouses, and Mary had motored from
Hastings; Rose was there too, with a daughter’s privileges.
They were all sitting in the dining-room over a late and chilly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>meal. They had been upstairs to the sick-room, where the
prodigals had entered unforbidden, for Sir John knew neither
sheep nor goat. His vexed mind had withdrawn itself to
the inmost keep of the assaulted citadel, in preparation for
its final surrender of the fortress it had held with such difficulty
of late.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There is no good saying that I expect him to recover this
time,” Dr. Mount had said. “I will not say it is impossible—doctors
are shy of using that word—but I don’t expect it,
and, in view of his former condition which would be tremendously
aggravated by this attack, I don’t think anyone can
hope it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Will it be long?” asked Doris, in a harsh, exhausted voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t think it will be longer than forty-eight hours.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Doris burst into tears. Her grief was, the family thought,
excessive. All her life, and especially for the last three months,
her father had victimised her, browbeaten her, frustrated her,
humiliated her—she had been the scapegoat of the revolted
sons and daughters—and yet at his death she had tears and
a grief which none of the more fortunate could share.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I found him—it was I who found him”—she sobbed out
her story for the dozenth time. “I came into the study with
his hot milk—Wills has refused to bring it ever since poor
Father threw it in his face—and I saw him sitting there, and
he looked funny, somehow. I knew something was wrong—he
was all twisted up and breathing dreadfully.... And I
said ‘Father, is anything the matter?—aren’t you feeling well?’
And he just managed to gasp ‘Get out.’ Those were the last
words he uttered.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir John had not been put to bed in his attic-bedroom, the
scene of his ignoble tea-making, but in his old room downstairs,
leading out of Lady Alard’s. She and the nurse were
with him now while the others were at supper. She had a
conviction that her husband knew her, as he made inarticulate
sounds of wrath when she came near. But as he did the same
for the nurse, the rest of the family were not convinced.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“When <em>is</em> Peter coming?” groaned Doris—“I really call it
heartless of him to keep away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But he doesn’t know what’s happened,” soothed Jenny—“he’ll
come directly he’s heard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t understand what he’s doing out at this hour. It’s
too late for any business, or for shooting—where can he have
gone?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll be getting an answer to your second message soon,”
said Ben Godfrey.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I daresay Peter thought he’d have his dinner first,” continued
Doris—“I expect he thought it didn’t matter and he
could come round afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t think that’s in the least likely,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then why doesn’t he come?—he can’t be out at this hour.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He must be out—or he would have come.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s not so very late,” said Jenny, “only just after nine.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He may have gone out to dinner somewhere,” said Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, that’s quite possible,” said Jenny—“he may have gone
somewhere on business and been asked to stay—or he may
have met someone when he was out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve a strong feeling that it mightn’t be a bad plan to
’phone to Stella Mount.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But Dr. Mount ’phoned there an hour ago, saying he’d be
here all night. She’d have told him then if Peter was there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think it quite probable that she would not have told him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What exactly do you mean by that, Rose?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mean?—oh, nothing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then there’s no use talking of such a thing. I’m quite
sure that if Peter had been at the Mounts’, Stella would have
sent him over directly she heard about Father.”</p>

<p class='c015'>At that moment Wills came into the room with a note for
Doris.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That must be from Starvecrow,” she said, taking it. “Yes,
it’s from Mrs. Asher—‘Peter hasn’t been in yet, and we are
beginning to feel anxious. He told us he was going out to
shoot rabbits and one of the farm men saw him start out with
his gun and Breezy. Of course he may have met someone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>and gone home with them to dinner. As you have a ’phone,
perhaps you could ring up one or two places.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We could ring up the Parishes,” said Jenny—“he may have
gone there. Or the Hursts—aren’t they on the ’phone? I
don’t think the Fullers are.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s an extraordinary thing to me,” said Rose, “that he
should stop out like this without at least sending a message
to his wife. He might know how anxious she’d be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter isn’t the most thoughtful or practical being on earth.
But there’s no good making conjectures. I’m going to ’phone
every place I can think of.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny spoke irritably. Rose never failed to annoy her, and
she was growing increasingly anxious about Peter. She had
told the others of his visit that afternoon, but she had not told
them of his queer, gruff, silent manner. Not that she had
seen, or saw now, anything sinister in it, but she could not
rid herself of the thought that Peter had been “queer,” and
that to queer people queer things may happen.</p>

<p class='c015'>The telephone yielded no results. Neither the Parishes nor
the Hursts were harbouring Peter, nor could she hear of
him at the Furnace or Becket’s House, or at the Vinehall
solicitor’s, or the garage at Iden, the final resorts of her desperation.
Of course he had friends who were not on the telephone,
but it was now after ten o’clock, and it was difficult
to believe that if he had accepted a casual invitation to dine
he would not have come home or sent word.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Lord! how ghastly it is,” she cried, as she hung up the
receiver for the last time—“Father dying and Peter disappeared.
What <em>are</em> we to do, Ben?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think we ought to go and have a look for him,” said her
husband.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How?—and who’d go?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll get a chap or two from here, and the men at Starvecrow.
If he was only out after conies he wouldn’t have gone
far—down to the Bridge, most likely. We ought to search
the fallows.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, do go,” said Doris—“it’s the only thing to be done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>now. I know something dreadful has happened to him. And
perhaps tomorrow he’ll be Sir Peter Alard....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She had forgotten that Godfrey was the presumptuous boor
who had disgraced her name. She saw in him only the man
of the family—the only man of the family now.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll ring for Wills, and he’ll see about lanterns—and perhaps
Pollock would go with you. And Beatup and Gregory
know the district well—I’ll have them sent for from the farm.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Reckon I’d better go up to Starvecrow, John Elias would
come with me, and Lambard and Fagge.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you’re going to Starvecrow,” said Jenny, “I’ll go too,
and see if I can do anything for poor Vera. I expect she’s
dreadfully worried and frightened.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t go!” cried Doris—“suppose Father died....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t see what good I should be doing here. Vera needs
me more than you do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’s got her mother. And it would be dreadful if Father
died while you were out of the house.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not more dreadful than if I was in it. He doesn’t know
me, and wouldn’t see me if he did.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think you’re very heartless,” and Doris began to cry—“Father
might recover consciousness just before the end and
want to forgive you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t think either is the least likely. Come along, Ben.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her husband fetched her coat from the hall, and they set
out together. Doris sat on in her chair at the head of the
table, sobbing weakly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think this is a terrible thing to have happened. Father
and Peter going together.... It makes me almost believe there
isn’t a God.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But we’ve no reason to think Peter’s dead,” said Mary—“a
dozen other things may have happened. He may have
broken his leg out in the fields and be unable to get home, in
which case the men will soon find him. I don’t see why you
need take for granted that he’s killed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think it far more likely that he’s gone off with Stella
Mount,” said Rose, relieved of Jenny’s repressing presence.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>“Why ever should you think that?” said Mary. “I wasn’t
aware that he was in love with her—now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s been in love with her for the last year. Poor Vera’s
had a dreadful time. I’m sure she thinks Peter’s gone with
Stella.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Really, Rose, you surprise me—and anyhow, Stella answered
her father’s ’phone call a short time ago, so she must
be at home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She might just have been going to leave when he rang up.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, the ’phone’s in the next room if you like to give her
a call—and know what to say to her. Personally I should
find the enquiry rather delicate.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It won’t do any good my ringing up,” sulked Rose—“if
they’re gone we can’t stop them. If they’ve not gone then
Doris is right, and Peter’s probably killed or something. I
don’t know which would be the worst. It’s dreadful to think
of him chucking everything over when if he’d only waited
another hour he’d have heard about Father’s illness. He’d
never have gone if he’d known he was to be Sir Peter so
soon.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’d rather he’d gone than was killed,” said Doris—“the
other could be stopped and hushed up—but if he’s dead&#160;... there’s nobody left.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What about Gervase?” asked Mary.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s no good.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Surely he’d come out of his convent or whatever it is, if
he knew he had succeeded to the property.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t know. Gervase never cared twopence about the
property. I don’t think he’d come out for that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They wouldn’t let him out,” said Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is he coming here now?” asked Mary.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wired to him when I wired to you and Jenny. But I
don’t know whether he’ll come or not, and anyhow he can’t
be here for some time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What time is it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nearly twelve.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The three women shivered. The fire had gone out.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ 22</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The night wore on, and Sir John was still alive. Nobody
thought of going to bed, but after a time Doris, Mary and
Rose went upstairs to the greater warmth of their father’s
dressing-room. Here through the open door they could see
the firelight leaping on the bedroom ceiling, and hear the occasional
hushed voices of the nurse and Dr. Mount. Lady
Alard sat by the fire, mute and exhausted. For the first time
that they could remember she gave her family the impression
of being really ill. Speller made tea, cocoa and soup on
the gas-ring in the dressing-room. Hot drinks were at once a
distraction and a stimulant. The night seemed incredibly
long—nobody spoke above whispers, though every now and
then Rose would say—“There’s no good whispering—he
wouldn’t hear us even if we shouted.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I do hope he really is unconscious,” said Doris.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dr. Mount says he is.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But how can he know? He knows Father can’t speak,
but he doesn’t know he can’t hear us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I expect there are signs he can tell by.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The last words he ever spoke were said to me. That’ll be
something comforting to remember.... But oh, it was dreadful
finding him like that! I do hope it hadn’t lasted long&#160;...
that he hadn’t been like that for a long time, all alone....”</p>

<p class='c015'>Doris bowed her head into her hands and sobbed loudly.
As she sat there, crouched over the fire, her face with the
merciful powder and colour washed off by tears, all haggard
and blotched, and the make-up of her eyes running down her
cheeks, her hair tumbling on her ears, and revealing the dingy
brown roots of its chestnut undulations—she looked by far the
most stricken of the party, more even than the sick man, who
but for his terrible breathing lay now in ordered calm.</p>

<p class='c015'>A clock in the house struck three.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wonder when we’ll hear about Peter,” whispered Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m surprised we haven’t heard already,” said Mary—“They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>must have gone all over the Starvecrow land by now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Um....” said Rose, “that seems to point to his not
being anywhere about the place.” Then she added—“I wonder
if Gervase will come. I shouldn’t be at all surprised if
he didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I should. They’d never keep him back when his father’s
dying.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well—why isn’t he here? He’s known about it for over six
hours.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I shouldn’t think there were any trains running now. It’s
not so easy as all that to come from Brighton.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Rose relapsed into silence. After a time she said—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Religion is a great consolation at a time like this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you think we ought to send for Mr. Williams to come
and see Father?” choked Doris.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—of course not. What good could he do? Poor Sir
John’s quite unconscious.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But he may be able to hear. How <em>do</em> you know he can’t?
Perhaps he would like to hear Mr. Williams say a prayer or
a hymn.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear Doris, I tell you he doesn’t know a thing, so
what’s the good of dragging poor Mr. Williams out of his
bed at three o’clock in the morning? I had no patience with
the people who did that sort of thing to George. Sir John
couldn’t understand anything, and if he did he’d be furious,
so it doesn’t seem much good either way. When I said religion
was a consolation I was thinking of Mary.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And why of me?” asked Mary.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I often think you’d be happier if you had some sort
of religion. You seem to me to lead such an aimless life.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course I’d be happier. Most people are happier when
they believe in something. Unfortunately I never was taught
anything I could or cared to believe.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mary! How can you say that, when poor George....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She broke off as the door opened and Jenny suddenly appeared.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>“Hullo, Jenny!” cried Doris—“have you come back?—Have
they found Peter?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny did not speak. She shut the door behind her, and
stood with her back against it. Her face was white and damp.
It was evidently raining, and wet strands of hair were plastered
on her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is Dr. Mount in there?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—but Jenny&#160;... Peter!...”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I must see Dr. Mount first.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Who’s that asking for me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The doctor came in from the next room; at the sight of
Jenny he shut the communicating door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I want to speak to you, Dr. Mount. Will you come with
me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jenny, you really can’t treat us like this,” cried Mary,
“you must tell us what’s happened. Is Peter hurt?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—he’s downstairs.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is he dead?” cried Doris, springing to her feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>Again Jenny did not speak. She bowed her head into her
hands and wept silently.</p>

<p class='c015'>A dreadful silence filled the little room. Even Doris was
perfectly quiet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll come down,” said Dr. Mount.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So’ll I,” said Doris.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” said Jenny, “you mustn’t see him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s—he’s been dreadfully injured—part of his head....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She stopped and shuddered. Dr. Mount pushed quietly
past her to the door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think I’d better go down alone. Your husband and
the men are down there—I can get all the information I want
from them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny came forward to the fire and flopped into the chair
Doris had left. Her clothes were wet and her boots muddy—it
must be raining hard.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d better tell you what happened,” she said brokenly—“The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>men—some from here and some from Starvecrow—found
Peter lying on the Tillingham marshes about half a mile below
the Mocksteeple. His dog was watching beside him, and
he’d been shot through the head.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Murdered,” gasped Doris.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—I don’t think so for a moment.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was an accident, of course,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wish I could think that. But the men seemed to think—my
husband too—that it was his own doing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“His own doing! Suicide!” cried Doris—“How could they
imagine such a thing?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“From the way he was lying, and the position of the
gun, and the nature of the injuries. That’s why I was so
anxious for Dr. Mount to see him and give an expert
opinion.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is there any chance of his being still alive?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not the slightest. His head is nearly entirely blown away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Jenny, don’t!—it’s dreadful!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes it’s dreadful, but I’m afraid it’s true.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But whatever could have made him kill himself?” moaned
Doris—“He’d nothing on his mind—he was perfectly happy&#160;... it couldn’t have been because the baby was a girl.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Peter may have had troubles that we don’t know of,” said
Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He must have,” said Jenny, “though I don’t think for a
minute they were of the kind you’ve been suspecting.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t see what other kind they could be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It may have been something to do with the estate.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’d never have killed himself for that. If anything had
gone wrong there, it was more than ever his duty to keep
alive.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, there’s no good us arguing here about what he did
it for—if he really did do it. The question is—who is going
to tell Mother?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Jenny....”</p>

<p class='c015'>They looked at each other in consternation.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Lady Alard, for all her frailty, belonged to a tougher
generation than her children. In times of prosperity she might
languish, but in times of adversity her spirit seemed to stiffen
in proportion to the attacks upon it. If her cook had given
notice she would have taken to her bed, but now when catastrophe
trod on catastrophe and the fatal illness of her husband
was followed by the death of her first-born son she armed
herself with a courage in which her children, careless of
kitchen tragedies, seemed to fail when they met the bigger
assaults of life. She was less shattered by the news of Peter’s
death than was the daughter who broke it to her, and rising
up out of her chair, independent of arm or stick, she insisted
on going downstairs into the dark, whispering house.</p>

<p class='c015'>The others followed her, except Doris, who stayed huddled
and motionless in her chair in her father’s dressing-room, like
a stricken dog at its master’s door. The dining-room was
lighted up and seemed full of men. They were gathered
round the table on which, with a sense of futility and pathos
Jenny caught sight of a pair of stiff legs in muddy boots.</p>

<p class='c015'>At the sound of footsteps Dr. Mount came out of the room.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What! Lady Alard!” he exclaimed, quite unprepared for
such a visit.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I want to see him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You can’t—yet!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you quite sure he’s dead?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Quite sure.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Dr. Mount looked shaken—his face was grey. But all faces
were grey in the light of the hall, where the first livid rays
of morning were mixing with the electric lamps that had
burned all night.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How did it happen, Doctor? Does anyone know?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nobody knows. He was found on the Tillingham marshes.
His gun may have gone off accidentally.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“May have....” repeated Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Will there have to be an inquest?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>“I’m afraid so. There always is in these cases.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, Sir John has been spared something.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her voice broke for the first time, and she turned back to
the stairs. Rose and Mary went with her but Jenny lingered
in the hall, where she had the comfort of seeing her husband
through the dining-room door. Dr. Mount stopped as he was
going back into the room.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Has anyone told his wife?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—one of the men came to Starvecrow at once.... I
told her.... They thought it best not to take him there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course—quite right. How did she bear it?—Perhaps I
ought to go and see her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Her mother’s with her, but I’m sure they’d be glad if you
went there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve got the car—I could run round in a few minutes. I
must go home too&#160;... one or two things to see to&#160;... I
don’t think I’m wanted here just now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The doctor seemed terribly shaken by Peter’s death, but
that was very natural, considering he had known him from a
child. Also, Jenny reflected, being a religious man, the idea
of suicide would particularly appall him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Doctor—do you—do you think he did it himself?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sorely afraid he did.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But what can have made him?&#160;... I mean, why should
he? I always thought he was so happy—too happy, even. I
sometimes thought him self-satisfied and over-fed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We all have our secrets, Jenny, and your brother must
have had a heavier one than most of us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But why should you be so sure he did it? Couldn’t his
gun have gone off by accident?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course it could. But the wounds would hardly have
been of such a nature if it had. However, the matter will
probably be cleared up in the Coroner’s court.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny shuddered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wonder if he’s had any trouble—anything worse than
usual about the land....” Then she remembered Rose’s
suspicions of Stella Mount. Her colour deepened as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>stood before Stella’s father. Could that possibly be the reason,
after all? She had never imagined such a thing, but Peter
certainly had been fond of Stella once, and Rose’s gossip was
seldom quite baseless. She did not believe for a moment in
any intrigue, but Peter might have turned back too late to his
early love&#160;... and of course Stella was going away&#160;... it
might have been that. Since undoubtedly Peter had had a
secret buried under the outward fatness of his life, that secret
may just as well have been Stella....</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your husband tells me he came to see you this afternoon,”
the doctor was saying, “what was he like then?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He seemed rather queer and silent, but afterwards I put
it down to its being his first visit since my marriage. He
wouldn’t forgive me for a long time, as you know, so it was
only to be expected that he should feel a little awkward. But
he said some rather queer things about Starvecrow—said he
wished it was more like Fourhouses, said he’d spoilt it with
his improvements, and seemed much more upset about it than
you’d think natural.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Um.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The doctor was silent a moment, then he said—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I think I’ll run over to Starvecrow in a minute or
two when I’ve finished with poor Peter, then I might as well
go home and have an early breakfast, and see if there are
any messages for me. I’ll be back in a couple of hours.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He moved away from her, and was going into the dining-room
when Rose’s frightened voice suddenly shuddered down
the stairs.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dr. Mount—will you please come up at once. There’s a
change in Sir John.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 24</h3>

<p class='c014'>Sir John Alard died when the cocks were crowing on Starvecrow
and Glasseye and Doucegrove, and on other farms of his
wide-flung estate too far away for the sound to come to
Conster. His wife and daughters and daughter-in-law were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>with him when he died, but he knew no one. His mind did
not come out of its retreat for any farewells, and if it had,
would have found a body stiffened, struggling, intractable, and
disobedient to the commands of speech and motion it had
obeyed mechanically for nearly eighty years. Death came and
brought the gift of dignity—a dignity he had never quite
achieved in all his lifetime of rule. When his family came
in for a last look, after the doctor and the nurse had performed
their offices, they saw that the querulous, irascible old man
of the last few months was gone, and in his place lay Something
he had never been of stillness and marble beauty. When
Dr. Mount had invited them in to the death-chamber, the
daughters had at first refused, and changed their minds only
when they found that Lady Alard was unexpectedly ready to
go. Now Jenny at least was glad. It was her first sight of
death (for she had not seen George’s body and would never
see Peter’s) and she was surprised to find how peaceful and
triumphant the body looked when set free from the long
tyranny of the soul. It comforted her to know that in its
last fatal encounter with terror, pain and woe, humanity was
allowed to achieve at least the appearance of victory. Her
father lying there looked like one against whom all the forces
of evil had done their worst in vain.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nobody cried except Doris, who cried a great deal. She
had not cried for Peter, but when her father’s spirit had slipped
out after a sigh, she had burst into a storm of noisy weeping.
She was sobbing still, kneeling beside the body of the
father who had bullied and humiliated her all her life, the
only one of his children who really regretted him.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was the sound of wheels in the drive below.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is that Gervase?” asked Jenny, going to the window.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” said Mary, “it’s Dr. Mount going away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He seems in a great hurry to get off,” said Rose—“he didn’t
wait a minute longer than he could possibly help.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t wonder,” said Jenny.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I expect he’s gone home to break it to Stella,” whispered
Rose.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>“He told me he was going to Starvecrow to see Vera,” said
Jenny icily. She hated Rose’s conjectures all the more that
she now shared them herself.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It will be dreadful for some people at the inquest,” continued
her sister-in-law.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dreadful! how dreadful?—You don’t mean Stella’s to
blame, do you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, of course, I don’t mean she’s really done anything
wicked—but she let poor Peter go on loving her when she
knew it was wrong.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How could she have stopped him?—supposing it’s true that
he did love her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Any girl can stop a man loving her,” said Rose mysteriously.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, can she?—it’s obvious you’ve never had to try.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jenny was surprised at her own vindictiveness, but she felt
all nerves after such a night. Rose was plunged into silence,
uncertain whether she had been complimented or insulted,
and the next minute there was another sound of wheels in
the drive.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That must be Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A taxi had stopped outside the door, and out of it climbed,
not Gervase but Brother Joseph of the Order of Sacred Pity,
with close-cropped hair, a rough, grey cassock and the thickest
boots man ever saw. As she watched him from the window,
Jenny felt a lump rise in her throat.</p>

<p class='c015'>She was going down to meet him when suddenly Doris
started up from the bedside.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let me go first.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She brushed past her sister and ran downstairs before anyone
could stop her. Jenny hurried after her, for she felt that
Doris in her present condition was not a reassuring object
to meet the home-comer. But she was too late. Doris
flung open the door almost at the same instant as the bell
rang.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Welcome!” she cried hysterically—“Welcome—Sir Gervase
Alard!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>§ 25</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>If Gervase was taken aback at his sister’s appearance, he
did not show it by more than a sudden blink.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear Doris,” he said, and taking both her hands he
kissed her poor cheek where rouge and tears were mingled—“I
met Dr. Mount—and he’s told me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“About Peter?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He came into the hall and stood there a quaint, incongruous
figure in his cloak and cassock.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hullo, Wills,” as the butler came forward.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How do you do, Mr. Gervase—I mean Sir Ger—or rather
I should say——”</p>

<p class='c015'>He remembered that his young master was now Brother
Something-or-other, having crowned an un-squirelike existence,
much deplored in the servants’ hall, by entering a Home for
Carthlicks. He compromised with—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Can I have your luggage, sir?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here it is,” said Gervase, holding out on one finger a
small bundle tied up in a spotted handkerchief, and Wills
who was going to have added “and your keys, sir,” retired
in confusion.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where’s Peter?” asked Brother Joseph.</p>

<p class='c015'>“In there,” Jenny pointed into the dining-room where Peter
still lay, now no longer pathetic and futile in booted and muddy
death, but dignified as his father upstairs under his white sheet.</p>

<p class='c015'>Young Alard went in, and standing at the head of the
table, crossed himself and said the first prayer that had been
said yet for Peter. His sisters watched him from the doorway.
Doris seemed calmer, her tears came more quietly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How’s Mother?” he asked as he came out.</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’s been wonderful,” said Jenny, “but I think she’s breaking
a bit now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And Vera?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Vera had not been wonderful. It is difficult to be wonderful
when your husband has killed himself because he loved another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>woman and you did not die in childbirth to let him marry
her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s dreadful,” moaned Jenny. Then suddenly she wondered
if Gervase knew the worst. There was a look of bright
peace in his eyes which seemed to show that he was facing
sorrow without humiliation or fear.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Did Dr. Mount tell you that—tell you exactly how Peter
died?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He told me he had been killed accidentally out shooting.
He gave me no details—he couldn’t wait more than a minute.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, my dear, it was much worse than that....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She saw that once again she would have to “break it” to
somebody. It was easier telling Gervase than it had been to
tell the others, for he did not cry out or protest, but when she
had finished she saw that his eyes had lost their bright peace.</p>

<p class='c015'>Doris was sobbing again, uncontrollably.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The two of them gone—first Peter and then Father. To
think that Peter should have gone first.... Thank God
Father didn’t know! He didn’t know anybody, Gervase—the
last person he recognised was me. That will always be a comfort
to me, though it was so dreadful.... I went into the
library, and found him all huddled there, alone&#160;... and I
said ‘Are you ill, Father?’—and he said ‘Get out’—and now,
Gervase, you’re the head of the family—you’re Sir Gervase
Alard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ll talk that over later. At present I must go and see
Mother.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you’re not going to back out of it—you’re not going
to leave us in the lurch.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hope I shan’t leave anybody in the lurch,” he replied
rather irritably, “but there are lots of more important things
than that to settle now. Where is Mother, Jenny?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’s upstairs in Father’s dressing-room.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She noticed that he looked very white and tired, and realised
that he must have been travelling for the greater part of the
night.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>“Are you hungry, dear? Won’t you eat something before
you go up?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No thank you—I don’t want anything to eat. But might
I have a cup of tea?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Speller’s making that upstairs, so come along.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They were halfway up, and had drawn a little ahead of
Doris, when he bent to her and whispered—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Does Stella know?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—Dr. Mount was on his way home when you met him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I’m glad.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So he, too, perhaps thought Stella might be the reason....</p>

<p class='c015'>The little dressing-room was full of people. Ben Godfrey
was there, the son-in-law and the man of the house till Gervase
came. Mr. Williams was there too, summoned by Rose at a
seasonable hour. He was sitting beside Lady Alard, who had
now begun to look old and broken, and was trying to comfort
her with a picture of her husband and son in some nebulous
Paradisaical state exclusive to Anglican theology. He looked
up rather protestingly at the sight of Gervase, whose habit
suggested rival consolations and a less good-natured eschatology.
But young Alard had not come to his mother as a religious,
but as her son. He went up to her, and apparently
oblivious of everyone else, knelt down beside her and hid his
face in her lap. “Oh, Mummy—it’s too terrible—comfort me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>His sisters were surprised, Ben Godfrey was embarrassed,
Rose and Mr. Williams tactfully looked another way. But
Lady Alard’s face lit up with almost a look of happiness.
She put her arms round him, hugging his dark cropped head
against her bosom, and for the first time seemed comforted.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 26</h3>

<p class='c014'>The Mounts’ little servant had gone to bed by the time Stella
came home from church, so she did not hear till the next
morning of the message from Starvecrow. Her father had
rung her up earlier in the evening to say that he would probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>not be home that night; and she was not to sit up for
him. So she carefully bolted both the doors, looked to see
if the kitchen fire was raked out, pulled down a blind or two,
and went upstairs.</p>

<p class='c015'>She was not sorry to be alone, for her mind was still wandering
in the dark church she had left&#160;... coal black, without
one glimmer of light, except the candle which had shown
for a moment behind the altar and then flickered out in the
draughts of the sanctuary. Spring by spring the drama of
the Passion searched the deep places of her heart. The office
of Tenebrae seemed to stand mysteriously apart from the other
offices and rites of the church, being less a showing forth of
the outward events of man’s redemption than of the thoughts
of the Redeemer’s heart.... “He came, a man, to a deep
heart, that is to a secret heart, exposing His manhood to
human view.” Throughout those sad nocturnes she seemed
to have been looking down into that Deep Heart, watching its
agony in its betrayal and its forsaking, watching it brood on
the scriptures its anguish had fulfilled.... “From the lamentations
of Jeremiah the Prophet”&#160;... watching it comfort
itself with the human songs of God’s human lovers, psalms of
steadfastness and praise—then in the Responds breaking once
more into its woe—a sorrowful dialogue with itself—“Judas,
that wicked trader, sold his Lord with a kiss”—“It had been
good for that man if he had not been born”&#160;... “O my
choicest vine, I have planted thee. How art thou turned to
bitterness”&#160;... “Are ye come out against a thief with swords
and staves for to take me?”&#160;... “I have delivered my beloved
into the hand of the wicked, and my inheritance is become
unto me as a lion in the wood”—“My pleasant portion is desolate,
and being desolate it crieth after me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Through psalm and lesson, antiphon and response, the Deep
Heart went down into the final darkness. It was swallowed up,
all but its last, inmost point of light—and that too was hidden
for a time&#160;... “keeping His divinity hidden within, concealing
the form of God.” In the darkness His family knelt and
prayed Him to behold them; then for a few brief moments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>came the showing of the light, the light which had not been
extinguished but hidden, and now for a few moments gleamed
again.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was all to the credit of Stella’s imagination that she
could make a spiritual adventure out of Tenebrae as sung in
Vinehall church. The choir of eight small boys and three
hoarse young men was rather a hindrance than an aid to
devotion, nor was there anything particularly inspiring in the
congregation itself, sitting on and on through the long-drawn
nocturnes in unflagging patience, for the final reward of seeing
the lights go out. Even this was an uncertain rite, for old
Mr. Bream, the sacristan, occasionally dozed at the end of
a psalm with the result that he once had three candles over
at the Benedictus; and another time he had let the Christ
candle go out in the draught at the back of the Altar and was
unable to show it at the end, though his hoarse entreaties for a
match were audible at the bottom of the church. But Stella
loved the feeling of this His family sitting down and watching
Him there in stolid wonder. She loved their broad backs,
the shoulders of man and girl touching over a book, the children
sleeping against their mothers, to be roused for the
final thrill of darkness. She was conscious also of an indefinable
atmosphere of sympathy, as of the poor sharing the
sorrows of the Poor, and drawn terribly close to this suffering
human Heart, whose sorrows they could perhaps understand
better than the well-educated and well-to-do. She felt herself
more at ease in such surroundings than in others of more
sophisticated devotion, and on leaving the church was indignant
with an unknown lady who breathed into her ear that she’d
seen it better done at St. John Lateran.</p>

<p class='c015'>Up in her bedroom, taking the pins out of her hair, her
mind still lingered over the office. Perhaps Gervase was singing
it now, far away at Thunders Abbey.... She must write
to Gervase soon, and tell him how much happier she had been
of late. During the last few weeks a kind of tranquillity had
come, she had lost that sense of being in the wrong with Peter,
of having failed him by going away. She saw that she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>right, and that she had hated herself for that very reason of
being in the right when poor Peter whom she loved was in
the wrong. But her being in the right would probably be more
help to him at the last than if she had put herself in the wrong
for his dear sake.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>She too might have sold her Lord with a kiss. She wondered
how often kisses were given as His price—kisses which
should have been His joy given as the token of His betrayal.
She might have given such a token if He had not preserved
her, delivered her from the snare of Peter’s arms&#160;... oh,
that Peter’s arms should be a snare&#160;... but such he himself
had made them. She had not seen him for a long time now—a
whole fortnight at least; and in less than another fortnight
she would be gone.... He was keeping away from her, and
would probably keep away until the end. Then once more he
would see Vera, his wife, holding their child in her arms&#160;...
and surely then he would go back. Probably in a few days
too he would be Sir Peter Alard, Squire of Conster, head of
the house&#160;... then he would be thankful that he had not
entangled himself with Stella Mount—he would be grateful to
her, perhaps....</p>

      <div class='line'>And, being desolate,—it crieth after me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>How the words would ring in her head!—breaking up her
thoughts. She felt very tired and sleepy—and she would have
to be up early the next morning. “My inheritance is as a
lion in the wood.”... Those words had made her think of
Starvecrow. She had always thought of Starvecrow as her
inheritance, the inheritance of which Peter had robbed her....
Starvycrow&#160;... oh, if only Peter had been true they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>might now be waiting to enter their inheritance together. Sir
John Alard could not have kept them out of it for more than
a few years. But Peter had cut her off, and Starvecrow was
strange to her—she dared not go near it&#160;... strange and
fierce—a lion in the wood.</p>

<p class='c015'>She was sorry for Sir John Alard, lying at the point of
death. She viewed his share in her tragedy with the utmost
tolerance. He had belonged to the old order, the toppling,
changing order, and it was not he who had failed the spirit
of life, but Peter, who belonged to the new but had stood by
the old. Poor Peter who had inherited only the things which
are shaken, when he was the heir of the kingdom which cannot
be moved....</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 27</h3>

<p class='c014'>Only her sudden waking showed her that she had been
asleep. She started up and looked at the time. This was
Good Friday morning, and it was now half-past six. She
jumped out of bed, hurried on her clothes, tumbled up her
hair, and was rather sleepily saying her prayers when she
heard the sound of her father’s car at the door. He was back,
then—all was over—Peter was now Sir Peter Alard, and
would not think of her again. Tears of mingled pity and
relief filled her closed eyes till the end of her bedside office—</p>

<p class='c015'>“May the souls of the faithful, through the mercy of God,
rest in peace. Amen.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She rose from her knees and ran downstairs to meet her
father. He was standing in the hall, pulling off his furry
driving gloves.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hullo, darling”—kissing his cold face—“Come in to the
surgery, and I’ll light the fire and get you some tea.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Were you going to church?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, but I shall have to be late, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have something to tell you, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c015'>His grave face sent a sudden chill into her heart.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Father!—what is it?—has anything happened to——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sir John Alard is dead——”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>“Well——”</p>

<p class='c015'>She knew that was not what he had to tell her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And Peter doesn’t inherit Conster.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She stared at him—she could not understand. Was Peter
illegitimate? Her heart sickened at the monstrous irony of
such a thought.... But it was impossible. She was conceiving
the preposterous in self-defence—in frantic hope that
Peter was not&#160;... dead.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is he dead?” she asked her father.</p>

<p class='c015'>He bowed his head silently.</p>

<p class='c015'>She could not speak. She was kneeling on the floor in front
of the unlighted fire. In one hand she held some sticks, and
for a time she could not move, but knelt there, holding out
the unkindled sticks towards the back hearth.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I felt I must come home and tell you before the rumour
reached you. He was found on the Tillingham marshes, with
his gun....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How?—an accident?” she mumbled vaguely.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t know, my dear—I’m afraid not.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mean....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I mean that from the way they tell me he was lying and
from the nature of the wounds, I feel nearly sure that it was
his own act. I am telling you this, poor darling, because you
would be sure to hear it some time, and I would rather you
heard it from me.”...</p>

<p class='c015'>“Will there be an inquest?” she heard herself asking calmly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, there’s sure to be an inquest. But of course I don’t
know what the findings will be, or if the Coroner will want
to question you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t mind if he does—I can answer.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She did not quite know what she was saying. She went
over and stood by the window, looking out. A mist was
rising from the garden, giving her an eastward vista of fields
in a far-off sunshine. The air was full of an austere sense of
spring, ice-cold, and pierced with the rods of the blossomed
fruit-trees, standing erect against the frigid sky.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her father came and put his arm around her.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>“Perhaps you would like to be alone, my dear—and I must
go and see poor Mrs. Peter. I came here first, because I
wanted to tell you&#160;... but now I must go to Starvecrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>(Starvycrow&#160;... being desolate it crieth after me.)</p>

<p class='c015'>He stooped and kissed her averted face.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My darling&#160;... I’m so sorry.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She felt a lump rise in her throat as if it would choke her—it
broke into a great sob.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Cry, dearest—it will do you good.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She gently pushed him from her—but when he was gone,
she did not cry.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 28</h3>

<p class='c014'>The little shrill bell of Vinehall church, the last of a large
family of pre-Reformation bells, was still smiting the cold
air, but Stella could not pray any more than she could weep.
Neither could she remain indoors. She put on her furs and
went out. She wished she had the car—to rush herself out
of the parish, out of the county, over the reedy Kentish border,
up the steep white roads of the weald, away and away to
Staplehurst and Marden, to the country of the hops and the
orchards.... But even so she knew she could not escape.
What she wanted to leave behind was not Vinehall or Leasan
or Conster or even Starvecrow, but herself. Herself and her
own thoughts made up the burden she found too heavy to
bear.</p>

<p class='c015'>She walked aimlessly down Vinehall Street, and out beyond
the village. The roads were black with dew, and the grass and
primrose-tufts of the hedgerow were tangled and wet. There
was nowhere for her to sit down and rest, though she felt
extraordinarily tired at the end of two furlongs. She turned
off into a field path, running beside the stacks of a waking
farm, and finally entering a little wood.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was a typical Sussex spinney. The oaks were scattered
among an underwood of hazel, beech and ash; the ground was
thick with dead leaves, sodden together into a soft, sweetsmelling
mass out of which here and there rose the trails of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>the creeping ivy, with the starry beds of wood-anemones;
while round the moss-grown stumps the primrose plants were
set, with the first, occasional violets. A faint budding of green
was on the branches of the underwood, so backward yet as to
appear scarcely more than a mist, but on the oaks above, the
first leaves were already uncurling in bunches of rose and
brown. Then at the bend of the path she saw a wild cherry
tree standing white like Aaron’s rod against the sky. The
whiteness and the beauty smote her through, and sinking down
upon one of the stumps, she burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p class='c015'>She cried because her pain had at last reached the soft
emotions of her heart. Hitherto it had been set in the hard
places, in self-reproach, in horror, in a sense of betrayal, both
of her and by her.... But now she thought of Peter, shut out
from all the soft beauty of the spring, cut off from life and
love, never more to smell the primroses, or hear the cry of the
plovers on the marsh, never more to watch over the lands he
loved, or see the chimney-smoke of his hearth go up from
Starvecrow.... She had robbed Peter of all this—she did
not think of him as cut off by his own act but by hers. It
was she who had killed him—her righteousness. So that she
might be right, she had made him eternally wrong—her Peter.
She had been the wicked trader, selling her lover for gain.
It had been well for her if she had not been born.</p>

<p class='c015'>The softer emotions had passed, and with them her tears.
She clenched her hands upon her lap, and hated herself. She
saw herself as a cold, calculating being. She had said “I will
get over it,” and she had said “Peter will get over it.” No
doubt she was right about herself—she would have got over it—people
like her always did; but about Peter she had been
hopelessly wrong. He had deeper feelings than she, and
at the same time was without her “consolations.” Her
“consolations”!—how thankful she had been that she had not
forfeited them, that she had not given them in exchange for
poor Peter. At first they had not seemed to weigh much
against his loss, but later on she had been glad and grateful;
and while she had been finding comfort in these things, building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>up her life again out of them, Peter had been going more and
more hungry, more and more forlorn, till at last he had died
rather than live on in starvation.</p>

<p class='c015'>She hated herself, but there was something worse than just
self-hatred in the misery of that hour. If she had betrayed
Peter it was that she, too, had been betrayed. She had been
given the preposterous task of saving her soul at the expense
of his. If she had not fled from the temptation of his presence—if
she had given way to his entreaties and promised not to
leave him without the only comfort he had left, Peter would
still be alive. She would have done what she knew to be
wrong, but Peter would not be dead in his sins. Why should
her right have been his wrong? Why should his dear soul have
been sacrificed for hers? He had died by his own hand—unfaithful
to his wife and child in all but the actual deed.
Why should she be forced to bear the guilt of that?</p>

<p class='c015'>The pillars of her universe seemed to crumble. Either
heaven had betrayed her or there was no heaven. She almost
preferred to believe the latter. Better ascribe the preposterous
happenings of the night to chance than to a providence which
was either malignant or careless of souls. Perhaps God was
like nature, recklessly casting away the imperfect that the fittest
might survive. Poor Peter’s starved, undeveloped soul had
been sacrificed to her own better-nourished organism, just as in
the kingdom of nature the weakest go to the wall.... She
looked round her at the budding wood. How many of these
leaves would come to perfection? How many of these buds
would serve only as nourishment to more powerful existences,
which in their turn would fall a prey to others. She would
rather not believe in God at all than believe in a Kingdom of
Heaven ruled by the same remorseless laws as the bloody
Kingdom of Nature....</p>

<p class='c015'>But she could not find the easy relief of doubt, though something
in her heart was saying “I will doubt His being rather
than His love.” After all, what was there to prove the assertion
that God is love?—surely it was the most monstrous, ultramontane,
obscurantist dogma that had ever been formulated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>The Real Presence, the Virgin Birth, the physical Resurrection
were nothing to it. It was entirely outside human knowledge—it
ran directly contrary to human experience&#160;... and yet it
was preached by those who looked upon the creeds as fetters
of the intellect and the whole ecclesiastical philosophy as absurd.
Fools and blind!—straining at a gnat and swallowing
a camel! She laughed out loud in the wood.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her laughter brought her to her senses—yes, she knew she
would always be sensible. She would either have to be sensible
or go mad. It is the sensible people who fill the asylums,
for they cannot rest in the halfway house of eccentricity. To
Stella it was a dreadful thing to have laughed out loud in a
wood. She was terrified, and jumped up at once to go home.
By the watch on her wrist it was half-past eight; her father
would be home from Starvecrow and wanting his breakfast.
Breakfast, dinner and tea&#160;... people like herself could never
forget breakfast, dinner and tea.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 29</h3>

<p class='c014'>“Well, my dear, did you go to church?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I went for a walk instead.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her tone was perfectly calm, if a little flat. She was really
being splendid, poor little girl.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase is back—I forget whether I told you. I met him
on my way home early this morning.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh—how does he look?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very well—though changed, of course, with his hair cut so
short. I’m glad he’s there. He’ll take Lady Alard out of
herself.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How is Lady Alard?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’s much better than I could have thought possible.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And Mrs. Peter?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’s different, of course&#160;... Jewish temperament, you
know. But I left her calmer. I think she’ll try and keep
calm for the sake of the child—she adores that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The doctor had had rather a rough time at Starvecrow, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>he would not tell Stella about it. Vera was in no doubt as to
the cause of her husband’s death, and as soon as Stella was
out of hearing, Dr. Mount was going to telephone to a Rye
practitioner to take charge of the case. Mrs. Peter was nearly
well, and really he could not go near her again after what she
had said....</p>

<p class='c015'>“When is the inquest going to be?” asked Stella abruptly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Tomorrow afternoon, my dear. Godfrey was at Conster,
and he says he’s seen the Coroner.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And shall I have to go?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I fear so. But no doubt you’ll get an official intimation.
You aren’t afraid, are you, sweetheart?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I’m not afraid.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Will you drive me out this morning? I must go over to
Benenden, and take Pipsden on the way back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I should like to drive you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So the day passed. In the morning she drove her father on
his rounds, in the afternoon she dispensed in the Surgery, and
in the evening there was church again. Church was black....
“And they laid him there, sealing the stone and setting a
watch.... Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in the place
of darkness, and in the deep—free among the dead, like unto
those who are wounded and lie in the grave, who are out of
remembrance.... And they laid him there, sealing a stone
and setting a watch.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The great three-days drama was over. For the last time
the Tenebrae hearse had stood a triangle of sinister light in the
glooms of the sanctuary. Tomorrow’s services would be the
services of Easter, in a church stuffed with primroses and gay
with daisy chains. What a mockery it all would be! How she
wished the black hangings could stay up and the extinguished
lamp before the unveiled tabernacle proclaim an everlasting
emptiness. She shuddered at the thought of her Easter duties.
It would be mere hypocrisy to perform them—she who wished
that she had mortal sin to confess so that Peter need not have
died in mortal sin.</p>

<p class='c015'>She thought of Gervase, so near her now at Conster, and yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>spiritually so very far away, in peaceful enjoyment of a Kingdom
from which she had been cast out. She had half expected
to see him in church that evening, but he had not been there,
and she had felt an added pang of loneliness. The sight of
him, a few words from him, might have comforted her. She
thought of Gervase as he used to be in the old days when he
first learned the faith from her. She almost laughed—she saw
another mockery there. She had taught him, she had brought
him to the fold—he himself had said that but for her he would
not have been where he was now—and now he was comforted
and she was tormented.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then as she thought of him, it struck her that perhaps he
might have written—that there might be a letter waiting for
her at home. Surely Gervase, who must guess what she was
suffering, would take some notice of her, try to do something
for her. Obsessed by the thought, she hurried home from
church—and found nothing.</p>

<p class='c015'>Though the expectation had not lasted half an hour, she was
bitterly disappointed. It was callous of him to ignore her like
this—he must know her position, he must guess her anguish.
She felt deserted by everyone, obscure and forsaken. It is
true that her father was near her and loved her and shared
her sorrow, but he did not know the full depths of it—he was
satisfied that she had done right, and thought that she, too, was
satisfied. She could not thrust her burden of doubt upon his
simple soul. She was becoming rapidly convinced that only
Gervase could share her burden with her, and if he stood
away&#160;... could she bear it alone?</p>

<p class='c015'>That night she scarcely slept at all. Her mind went round
and round on its treadmill, its sterile walk of questions and
regrets. In the small hours she must have dozed a little, for
she dreamed she had gone to a Mass for Peter’s soul, and
Gervase was the Priest. The server had just carried the Book
to the north end of the Altar, and she stood waiting to hear the
grail—“The righteous shall be held in everlasting remembrance:
he shall not be afraid of any evil tidings.” But instead
a terrible voice rang out: “I have delivered my beloved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>into the hand of the wicked, and my heritage is become unto
me as a lion in the wood.”... Trembling and panting, she
awoke to the realisation that no Mass could be said for Peter,
no office read; that he was not one of “the Faithful Departed”—that
good company of many prayers....</p>

<p class='c015'>She lay motionless, her face buried in the pillow, without
struggles or tears. She was aware, without sight of the dawn
breaking round her, of the cold white light which filled the
room, of the grey sky lying like a weight upon the trees. She
heard the wind come up and rustle round the house, and the
cocks begin to crow, some near, some far away—Padgeham
answering Dixter, and Wildings echoing Brickwall. The new
day had come—Holy Saturday, the day of peace, the last and
greatest of the Sabbaths, the seventh day on which God rested
from the six days’ labour of His new creation.</p>

<p class='c015'>She was roused by a clock striking eight, and again her
abominable sense asserted itself. She had never lain in bed
so long in her life—she must get up quickly, and give her
father his breakfast before he started on his rounds.</p>

<p class='c015'>With as it were leaden weights in her head and limbs, she
rose, dressed and went down. As she was going down the
stairs a kind of hope revived. Perhaps this morning there
would be a letter from Gervase....</p>

<p class='c015'>Yes, there was. It was lying in the letter box with a lot
of others. She eagerly tore it open and read—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Stella, dear—this is just to tell you how I feel for you and
am praying for you.—Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>That was all.</p>

<p class='c015'>A sick and silly feeling of disappointment seized her. She
knew now that for some unaccountable reason she had been
banking her hopes on that letter. She had been expecting
Gervase to resolve her doubts, to reconcile her conflicts. But
instead he seemed ridiculously to think she could do all that
for herself. Her heart warmed against him—perhaps he
shrank from coming to grips with the problem. His faith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>recoiled from the raw disillusion which he must know she was
feeling. He would keep away from her rather than be mixed
up in her dust.... Well, he should not. His aloofness should
not save him. She would go over to Conster and see him,
since he would not come to her. With a growing resentment
she told herself it was the least he could do for her. She had
given him his faith—he might at least make an effort to save
hers.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Father,” she said when they were at breakfast—“do you
mind driving yourself out this morning? I’m going to Conster
to see Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Certainly, my dear. I’m glad you’re going to see him—I
thought perhaps he might be coming here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So did I—but he’s asked me to go there instead.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Something in her detached and dispassionate said—“that lie
was quite well told.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 30</h3>

<p class='c014'>As soon as her father had gone, she set out for Conster.
She went by the road, for the field way ran near Starvecrow,
and she had not the courage to go by Starvecrow.</p>

<p class='c015'>She did not get to Conster till nearly eleven, and as she
walked up the drive she asked herself what she would do if
Gervase was out. She would have to wait, that was all. She
must see him—he was the only person on earth who could
help her.</p>

<p class='c015'>However, he was not out. Wills let her in very solemnly.
He did not attach any importance to the gossip in the servants’
hall—but&#160;... she looked ill enough, anyway, poor creature.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, Miss, Sir Gervase is in. I will tell him you’re here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella started a little—Sir Gervase! She had asked for Mr.
Gervase. She had forgotten. In her absorption in the main
stream of the tragedy she had ignored its side issues, but now
she began to realise the tempests that must be raging in Gervase’s
life. Would he have to leave his community, she
wondered—after all, he could easily come out, and great responsibilities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>awaited him. The next minute she gave another
start—as she caught her first sight of Brother Joseph.</p>

<p class='c015'>He seemed very far away from her as he shut the door
behind him. Between them lay all the chairs and tables, rugs
and plants of the huge, overcrowded drawing-room. For the
first time she became aware of a portrait of Peter on the wall—a
portrait of him as a child, with masses of curly hair and
wide-open, pale blue eyes. She stared at it silently as Gervase
came towards her across the room.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stella, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He took both her hands in his firm, kind clasp, and looked
into her eyes. His own seemed larger than usual, for his hair
was cut very close, almost shorn. That, and his rough grey
cassock buttoned collarless to his chin, altered his appearance
completely. Except for his touch and voice, he seemed almost
a stranger.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase....” she sank into a chair—“Help me, Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course I will. Did you get my note?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—but, oh, Gervase....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She could say no more. Her breath seemed gone. She held
her handkerchief to her mouth, and trembled.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I should have written more—but I’ve had such a time,
Stella, with my family and the lawyers. Perhaps you can
understand what a business it all is when I tell you that I’ve
no intention of coming out of the Order, which means I’ve
got to make up my mind what to do with this place. I’ve been
at it hard all yesterday afternoon and this morning with my
father’s London solicitors, but I’ve managed to keep the family
quiet till after the funeral, by which time I shall have the
details settled. Otherwise I should have come to see you....
But I knew you were safe.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase, I’m not safe.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear——”</p>

<p class='c015'>He held out his hand and she took it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not safe, Gervase. You think I’m stronger than I am.
And you don’t know what’s happened.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know all about Peter.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>“Yes, but you don’t know the details. You don’t know that
Peter killed himself because I insisted, in spite of all his
entreaties, on going away. He told me that my presence was
the only comfort he had left, but I wouldn’t stay, because if I
stayed I knew that I should be tempted, and I was afraid....
I thought it was my duty to run away from temptation. So I
ran. I never thought that perhaps Peter couldn’t live without
me—that I was saving my soul at the expense of his. I wish
now that I’d stayed—even if it had meant <em>everything</em>.... I’d
far rather sin through loving too much than through loving
too little.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So would I. But have you loved too little?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes—because I thought of myself first. I thought only of
saving my own soul&#160;... and I thought I could forget Peter
if only I didn’t ever see him again, and I thought he could
forget me. But he couldn’t—and I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“In other words, you did right and behaved very sensibly,
but the results were not what you expected.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase—if you tell me again that I’ve been ‘right’ and
‘sensible,’ I—oh, I’ll get up and go, because you’re being just
like everyone else. Father says I’ve been ‘right’ and ‘sensible’—and
I know Father Luce would say it—and the Coroner will
say it this afternoon. And it’ll be true—true—true! I have
been right and sensible, and my right has put Peter in the
wrong, and my sense has driven him mad.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And what would your ‘wrong’ have done for Peter?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’d still be alive.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“With your guilt upon him as well as his own. Stella, my
dear, listen to me. When I talk about your being ‘right’ I
don’t mean what most people would mean by right. If it’s
any comfort to you, I think that most people who have intelligence
and are not merely conventional would think you had
done wrong. You loved Peter and yet refused to have him,
with the result that his life is over and yours is emptied. I
know, and you know, that you did this because of an allegiance
you owed beyond Peter. But most people wouldn’t see that.
They’d think you had refused him because you were afraid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>because you dared not risk all for love. They’d never see that
all the daring, all the risk, lay in your refusing him. Now be
candid—isn’t part of your unhappiness due to your feeling that
it would have been braver and more splendid to have done what
Peter wanted, and let everything else go hang?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” said Stella faintly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’ll tell you what I think would have happened—if
you’d stayed—stayed under the only conditions that would have
satisfied Peter. Vera would have, of course, found out—she
has found out already a great deal more than has happened;
she’s not the sort of woman who endures these things; she
would have divorced Peter, and he would have married you.
Nowadays these scandals are very easily lived down, and you’d
have been Lady Alard. After a time the past would have been
wiped out—for the neighbourhood and for you. You would
probably have become extremely respectable and a little censorious.
You would have gone to Leasan church on Sundays
at eleven. You would have forgotten that you ever weren’t
respectable—and you would have forgotten that you ever used
to live close to heaven and earth in the Sacraments, that you
ever were your Father’s child.... In other words, Stella, you
would be in Hell.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Stella did not speak. She stared at him almost uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know what you think, my dear—you think you would have
undergone agonies of regret, and you tell yourself you should
have borne them for Peter’s sake. But I don’t think that. I
think you would have been perfectly happy. Remember, you
would have been living on a natural level, and though we’re
made so that the supernatural in us may regret the natural,
I doubt if the natural in us so easily regrets the supernatural.
Your tragedy would have been <em>that you would have regretted
nothing</em>. You would have been perfectly happy, contented,
comfortable, respectable, and damned.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But Peter—he——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Would probably have been the same. He isn’t likely to
have turned to good things after seeing how lightly they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>weighed with you. But the point is that you haven’t the charge
of Peter’s soul—only the charge of your own—‘Man cannot
deliver his brother from death or enter into agreement with
God for him.’ It cost very much more to redeem their souls
than you could ever pay.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Gervase, isn’t Peter’s soul lost through what he did—through
what I drove him to——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear, how do we know what Peter did? What do we
really know about his death? Can’t you take comfort in the
thought that perfect knowledge belongs only to Perfect Love?
As for your own share—your refusal to love your love for
him unto the death, your refusal to make it the occasion for
treachery to a greater love—that refusal may now be standing
between Peter’s soul and judgment. You did your best for
him by acting so—far better than if you had put him in the
wrong by making his love for you—probably the best thing
in his life—an occasion for sin. He takes your love out of
the world unspoilt by sin. Your love is with him now, pleading
for him, striving for him, because it is part of a much greater
Love, which holds him infinitely dearer than even you can hold
him. Stella, don’t you believe this?”</p>

<p class='c015'>She was crying now, but he heard her whisper “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then don’t go regretting the past, and thinking you would
have saved a man by betraying God.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll try not....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And suppose as the result of your refusing to stay, Peter
had turned back to Vera, and been happy in his wife and child
again, you wouldn’t have regretted your action or thought
you’d done wrong. Well, the rightness of your choice isn’t
any less because it didn’t turn out the way you hoped.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know—I know—but&#160;... I was so cold and calculating—one
reason I wanted to go away was that though I couldn’t have
Peter I didn’t want to go without love&#160;... for ever....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I scarcely call that ‘cold and calculating.’ I hope you will
love again, Stella, and not waste your life over has-beens and
might-have-beens. It’s merely putting Peter further in the
wrong if you spoil your life for his sake.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>“You think I ought to get married?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I certainly do. I think you ought to have married years
ago, and Peter was to blame for holding that up and damming
your life out of its proper course. He kept you from marrying
the right man—for Peter wasn’t the right man for you, Stella,
though probably you loved him more than ever you will love
the right man when he comes. But I hope he will come soon,
my dear, and find you—for you’ll never be really happy till
he does.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know, Gervase, I know—oh, do help me to be sensible
again, for I feel that after what’s happened, I couldn’t ever.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear, you don’t really want help from me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I do. Oh, Gervase&#160;... I wish I weren’t going to Canada—I
don’t feel now as if I could possibly go away from you.
You’re the only person that can help me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You know I’m not the only one.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You are. You’re the only one that understands&#160;... and
we’ve always been such friends.... I feel I don’t want to
go away from you—even if you’re still at Thunders....”</p>

<p class='c015'>She spoke at random, urged by some helpless importunity
of her heart. He coloured, but answered her quite steadily.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I shall never leave Thunders, my dear. It’s too late for
that now. I shall always be there to help you if you want me.
But I don’t think you really want me—I think you will be able
to go through this alone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Alone....”</p>

<p class='c015'>A few tears slid over her lashes. It seemed as if already she
had gone through too much alone.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, for you want to go through it the best way—the way
Love Himself went through it—alone. Think of Him, Stella—in
the garden, on the cross, in the grave—alone. ‘I am he
that treadeth the wine-press-alone.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Gervase, I can’t—I’m not strong enough. Oh&#160;...
oh, my dear, don’t misunderstand me—but you say you owe
your faith to me&#160;... can’t the faith I gave you help me now
that I’ve lost mine?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You haven’t lost it—it’s only hidden for a time behind the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Altar&#160;... you must go and look for it there. If you look for
it in me you may never find it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She rose slowly to her feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I see,” she said, as a blind man might say it.</p>

<p class='c015'>He, too, rose, and held out his hand to her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll know where I am—where I’ll always be—my life
given to help you, Stella, your brother, your priest. I will be
helping you with my thoughts, my prayers, my offices—with
my Masses some day, because, but for you I should never say
them. In that way I shall pay back all you’ve given me.
But to the human ‘me’ you’ve given nothing, so don’t ask anything
back. If I gave you anything in that way I might also
take—take what I must not, Stella. So goodbye.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She put her hand into his outstretched one.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Goodbye, Gervase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Goodbye.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She wondered if he would give her another of those free
kisses which had shown her so much when first he went away.
But he did not. They walked silently to the door, and in the
silence both of that moment and her long walk home she saw
that he had paid his debt to her in the only possible way—by
refusing to part with anything that she had given him.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>§ 31</h3>

<p class='c014'>That afternoon the Coroner’s inquest was held on Peter
Alard, and twelve good men and true brought in a verdict of
“accidental death.” The Coroner directed them with the conscientiousness
of his kind—he pointed out that, according to
medical opinion, the dead man’s wounds must almost certainly
have been self-inflicted; but on the other hand they had rather
conflicting evidence as to how the body was lying when found,
and the doctor could not speak positively without this. He
would point out to the witnesses the desirability of leaving the
body untouched until either a doctor or the police had been
summoned. No doubt they had thought they were doing right
in carrying him to his father’s house, but such action had made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>it difficult to speak positively on a highly important point.
As to the motives for suicide—they had heard Miss Mount’s
evidence, which he thought had been very creditably given—indeed,
he considered Miss Mount’s conduct to have been
throughout irreproachable, and whatever the findings of the
jury she must not blame herself for having acted as any right-minded
young lady would have done under the circumstances.
Feeling herself attracted by the deceased, a married man, and
realising that he was also attracted by her, she had very
properly decided to leave the neighbourhood, and but for her
father’s professional engagements would have done so at once.
The meeting at which she had made this decision known to
Mr. Alard had taken place two months ago, and it was for
the Jury to decide whether it was likely to have driven him
to take his life so long after the event. The deceased’s sister,
Mrs. Benjamin Godfrey, had told them of a conversation she
had had with him on the afternoon of his death. He seemed
then to have been preoccupied about his farm of Starvecrow,
and other evidence had shown that the estate was much encumbered,
like most big properties at the present time, though
the position was no more serious than it had been a year ago.
The Jury must decide if any of these considerations offered
sufficient motive for self-destruction, if the deceased’s manner
on the day of his death had been that of a man on the verge
of such desperate conduct, and if the medical evidence pointed
conclusively to a self-inflicted death. There were alternatives—he
enlarged on the nature of gun accidents, dismissed the
possibilities of murder—but the evidence for these hung on the
thread of mere conjecture, and was not borne out by medical
opinion.</p>

<p class='c015'>The verdict was a surprise to the family. The loophole left
by the Coroner had been so small that no one had expected
even a local Jury to squeeze through it. But these men had all
known Peter, many of them had done business with him, all
had liked him. No one of them would have him buried with
a slur upon his memory—no one of them would have his
widow’s mourning weighted with dishonour, or his child grow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>up to an inheritance of even temporary insanity—and incidentally
they all liked Miss Stella Mount, and had no intention
she should bear the burden of his death if they could help it.
So they brought in their verdict, and stuck to it, in spite
of some rather searching questions by the Coroner. They
wouldn’t even bring in an open verdict—they would do the
thing properly for the kindly Squire who had for so long stood
to them for all that was best in the falling aristocracy of the
land.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peter was buried with his father in Leasan churchyard, in
the great vault of the Alards, where all of them lay who had
not been buried at Winchelsea. He and Sir John mingled their
dust with Sir William the land-grabber, whose appetite for
farms lay at the bottom of all the later difficulties of the estate,
with Gervase the Non-Juror, with Giles who met his casual
loves at the Mocksteeple—with all the great company of Squires
who had lived at Conster, lorded Leasan, built and farmed and
played politics for nearly five hundred years. Perhaps as they
stood round the grave in the late April sunshine, some of the
family wondered if these were the last Alards for whom the
vault would be opened.</p>

<p class='c015'>Everyone went back to Conster after the funeral. Sir John’s
will had already been read by the solicitors. It presented no
difficulties—the whole estate went to Peter Alard and his heirs;
in the event of his dying without male issue, to Gervase. The
will had been made shortly after the death of George.</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase knew that now the time had come when he must
face his family. They were all there at tea, except Vera—who
was still unable to leave her room—and he could tell by a
certain furtive expectancy in some and uneasiness in others that
a crisis was impending. Doris was the head of the expectant
group, Jenny of the uneasy ones. Doris had never looked
more unlike the hysterical, dishevelled woman who had wept
for Sir John. In her new black frock, and her hat with the
plumes that swept down to her shoulders—powdered, rouged,
salved, pencilled and henna’d into elegance if not into beauty,
she seemed to have gathered up in herself all the pomp and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>circumstance of the Alards. There was not much of it to be
seen in Lady Alard’s weary preoccupation with the burnt
scones, in Rose’s glancing survey of the other women’s clothes,
in Mary’s rather colourless smartness, in Jenny’s restlessness
or her husband’s awkwardness—he had carried his first top-hat
into the drawing-room, and put it, with his gloves inside it,
on the floor between his large feet—and there was certainly
nothing of it in the present holder of the title, sitting with his
arms folded and thrust up the sleeves of his habit, his shoulders
hunched as with a sense of battles to come.</p>

<p class='c015'>Gervase considered that the sooner the row was over the
better; so, as no one seemed inclined to begin it, he decided to
start it himself.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mother, dear, do you think you could lend me five shillings?—At
least I’d better say give it to me, for I don’t suppose
there’s the slightest chance of your ever seeing it again.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, dear—but why&#160;... I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’ve only got eighteenpence left from the money
Father Peter gave me to come here, and the third class fare
to Brighton is six and six.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gervase,” shrieked Doris—“you’re not going back to that
place!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear, what else did you expect?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you won’t stay there—you won’t go on being a monk—you
won’t refuse to be Sir Gervase Alard!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I haven’t even begun to be a monk, and, according to the
solicitors, I’ll have to go on being Sir Gervase Alard to the
end of my days—but I’m going to stay there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But what’s to become of us? Gervase, you can’t be Squire
and not live here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let me explain myself. I’m not thinking of being Squire.
I forfeit all my rights absolutely, except the title, which I’m
told I can’t get rid of. But I shall sell the estate.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The silence that fell was almost terrifying. Doris sank back
in her chair as if fainting, Lady Alard covered her face, Rose
sat with her mouth open, Jenny and Godfrey stared at each
other.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>Lady Alard was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mean that you’re going to turn us out—your mother
and sisters—not even leave us a roof over our heads? And
what becomes of the furniture?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I shall of course consult your wishes about the house. If
you want to go on living here, the house and grounds are
yours.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But Gervase,” cried Doris hoarsely—“what good will the
house be to us without the land? Do you think we’re going to
live on here and see all the estate pieced out and flung to small-holders
and contractors?—I’d rather go and live in a slum.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If Gervase doesn’t mean to live here, I’m by no means sure
that I care to stay on,” said Lady Alard. “The morning-room
chimney smokes abominably, and the bedrooms are extremely
inconvenient—also, with my illness, I really think I ought to
live in a town. We might move into Hastings.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But Gervase doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” cried
Doris—“he can’t desert us and fling away his responsibilities
like this. Sell the estate! Oh, God—poor Father!” and she
burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c015'>Rose sprang to her feet with an indignant look at Gervase,
and put her arm round Doris’s heaving shoulders, but her
sister-in-law ungratefully pushed her away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m dreadfully sorry,” said Gervase, “but I really don’t
think I’m letting anyone down. I’ve gone into things pretty
thoroughly during the last few days, and really it would have
been extremely difficult for us to carry on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Difficult—but not impossible.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not impossible. But possible only in the way we’ve been
doing for the last ten years, and, honestly, do you think that’s
good enough?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s better than throwing everything overboard, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t think it is. By ‘throwing everything overboard,’
as you call it, we can at least save the land.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“For the last ten years we’ve been doing hardly anything for
the land. We’ve been unable to introduce up-to-date methods;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>we can’t even keep our farms in decent repair. If we hung
on now, still further crippled by death-duties, the land would
simply go to pot. By selling, we can save it, because it will
pass into the hands of men who will be able to afford it what
it needs. Possibly one or two of the tenants will buy their
farms. Anyhow, there won’t any longer be a great, big, unwieldy,
poverty-stricken estate, paying more in taxes than it
actually brings in profits and deteriorating every year for lack
of money spent on it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I’m perfectly sure that if you pulled yourself together
you could save the estate without cutting it in pieces. A conservative
government is sure to improve matters for us and
reduce taxation. I know Peter could have saved us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not Peter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you could save us if you wanted to. You’ve only to
put yourself at the head of things, and get a really good bailiff,
and perhaps sell an outlying farm or two to bring in a little
ready money.... But you won’t. That’s what you mean.
You don’t want to come out of your monastery and face the
world again. You could save us. But you won’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re quite right—I won’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The discussion had somehow become a dialogue between
Gervase and Doris. Why Doris should appoint herself as
Alard’s spokesman no one exactly knew, but none of the rest
made any effort to join in. Lady Alard was too deeply preoccupied
with the house and its impending changes to worry
about the land, Rose was angry with Doris for having repulsed
her, so would give her no support, Mary was indifferent, Godfrey
diffident, and Jenny, though revolting deeply from her
brother’s choice, was too loyal to him to take anyone else’s part.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I won’t because I can’t,” continued Gervase; “I can’t leave
the Abbey, even if I knew that by doing so I could save Conster.
I went there long before I’d the slightest notion I should
ever succeed to this place, but even if I’d known I should have
gone just the same. The only other thing I could do now
would be to appoint a trustee to administer the estate for me,
but in that way I should only be adding to the difficulties all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>round. By selling the place I’m doing the best possible thing
for the land and for everyone else. The land will run a chance
of being developed to its fullest value, instead of being neglected
and allowed to deteriorate, and I’ll be making a fairly
decent provision for Mother and all the rest of you—you’ll be
far better off than if we’d stuck to the old arrangement; you’ll
have ready money for about the first time in your lives.
Mother and Doris and Mary can live on here if they like, or
they can go and live in Hastings or in town. I think the sale
ought to realise enough to make everyone fairly comfortable—anyhow,
much more comfortable than they are in the present
state of things.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Gervase,” sobbed Doris—“you don’t seem to think of
the family.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What else am I thinking of? I’m just telling you that you
and Mary and Mother——”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But we’re not the family. I mean the whole thing—the
house of Alard. What’s to become of it if you go and sell
the estate, and shut yourself up in an Abbey, instead of coming
here and looking after the place, and marrying and having
children to succeed you? Don’t you realise that if you don’t
marry, the whole thing comes to an end?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m afraid it will have to come to an end, Doris. I can’t
save it that way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Doris sprang to her feet. She looked wild.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you must save it—you must. Oh, Gervase, you don’t
understand. I’ve given up my life to it—to the family. I’ve
given up everything. I could have married—but I wouldn’t—because
he wasn’t the sort of man for our family—he wasn’t
well-connected and he wasn’t rich—it would have been a comedown
for an Alard, so I wouldn’t have him—though I loved
him. I loved him&#160;... but I wouldn’t have him, because I
thought of the family first and myself afterwards. And now
you come along, undoing all my work—making my sacrifice
worthless. You don’t care twopence about the family, so
you’re going to let it be sold up and die out. We’re going to
lose our house, our land, our position, our very name.... I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>gave up my happiness for Alard, and you go and make my
sacrifice useless. Gervase, for God’s sake save us. You can—if
only you’ll come away from those monks and be Squire
here. I’m sure God can’t wish you to desert us. Gervase, I
beg you, I pray you to save the family—I pray you on my
knees....”</p>

<p class='c015'>And suiting the action to the word, she went down on her
knees before him.</p>

<p class='c015'>The others sat rooted to their chairs—partly at the sight of
Doris’s frenzy, partly of her humiliation, partly to hear the
multitudinous lovers she had always hinted at reduced in a
moment of devastating candour to one only. Gervase had
sprung to his feet. He trembled and had turned very white.
Then for a moment he, too, seemed to turn to stone.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I pray you,” repeated Doris hoarsely—“I pray you on my
knees....”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her brother recovered himself and, taking both her hands,
pulled her to her feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t, Doris....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then, will you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear, is the family worth saving?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What d’you mean?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Listen, Doris. You’ve just told me that you’ve given up
your life’s love and happiness to the family. Peter&#160;... I
know&#160;... gave up his. Mary gave up part of hers, but saved
a little. Jenny alone has refused to give up anything, and is
happy. Is our family worth such sacrifices?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her head drooped unexpectedly to his shoulder, and she
collapsed in weeping.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” he continued—“it isn’t worth it. The family’s taken
enough. For five hundred years it has sat on the land, and at
first it did good—it cared for the poor, it worked its farms to
the best advantage, and the estate prospered. But it’s outlived
those days—it’s only an encumbrance now, it’s holding back
the land from proper development, it’s keeping the yeoman and
small land-owner out of their rights, it can’t afford to care for
the poor. It can barely keep its hold on the land by dint of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>raising mortgages and marrying for money. It can only be
kept up by continual sacrifices—of the land, of the tenants,
of its own children. It’s like a wicked old dying god, that
can only be kept alive by sacrifices—human sacrifices. And
I tell you, it shan’t be any more.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was another pause, noisy with Doris’s weeping. The
other members of the family began to feel that they ought to
take their share in the argument. They none of them felt for
Alard what Doris so surprisingly felt, but after all they could
not sit round and watch Gervase turn the world upside down
without some protest.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You know I want to be reasonable,” said Jenny in rather
an uncertain voice, “and I don’t want to push you into a way
you don’t want to go. But from your own point of view, don’t
you think that all this that’s happened just shows—that—that
this religious life isn’t, after all, the right life for you—the life
you were meant for?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I always said it was very silly of Gervase to become a
monk,” said Lady Alard. “He could do quite a lot of good
in the parish if he lived at home. Mr. Williams said he was
looking for someone to manage the Boy Scouts.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, that was what poor George was always saying,” said
Rose—“‘Charity begins at home.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, don’t think I haven’t prayed over this,” cried Gervase—“that
I haven’t tried hard to see if, after all, my duty didn’t lie
in taking my place here and trying to save the property. But
I’m quite sure that isn’t my duty now. As I’ve tried to show
Doris, Conster simply isn’t worth saving. It’s lost its power
for good—it can only do harm, to the district and to us. It
had much better come to an end.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But even if you feel like that about the estate,” said Mary—“there’s
the family apart from the land. It’s rather dreadful
to think that a fine old family like ours should be deliberately
allowed to die out—the name become quite extinct. And it’s
not only for the family’s sake, but for yours. You’re a young
man—scarcely more than a boy. I think it’s dreadful that you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>should already have made up your mind to live without marriage
and die without children.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So do I!” cried Jenny, fierce at last.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve gone into all that,” said Gervase with a touch of
weariness, “and you know how I’ve decided.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But these new circumstances hadn’t arisen.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I shouldn’t have decided differently if they had.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not sure,” said Mary—“that even that other plan you
spoke of wouldn’t be best—better than selling everything, I
mean. Couldn’t you administer the estate through a bailiff
or trustee?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If my father and Peter couldn’t make it pay, what would
be the result of an absentee landlord?—the place wouldn’t
stand it. We’d bust. No, in fairness to the land it ought to
go back to the small landlords—that’s its only chance of recovery.
I’m not doing this only for our own sakes, but for
the sake of the land and the people it ought to belong to.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think you’re a traitor,” said Rose—“a traitor to your
house.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wish I was dead,” cried Doris. “First Father—then
everything else.... I’ve nothing to live for now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why, you’ve got me,” said Lady Alard—“You’ll come with
me, Doris. I think I shall go to Worthing—it’s more bracing
than the coast here. Gervase, do you think the dining-room
sideboard would fit into a smaller house?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Father,” sobbed Doris—“Oh, Father—oh, Peter....
What would you have done if you had known how it was
going to end?”</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
